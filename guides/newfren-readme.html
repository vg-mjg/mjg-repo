        <h1>What exactly is Mahjong?</h1>
        <p>Mahjong is a tile-based game most similar to a cross between Gin Rummy and Poker.  It was originally created in China, but the popularity spread quickly, and nearly every single area in Asia has its own variant. </p>
        <p>This <del>pastebin</del> article is focused solely on the Japanese variation, most commonly known as "Riichi" or "Reach" Mahjong.</p>

    <p>A   simple app to help you work on your efficiency in discards.  The app is   simplistic and doesn't take a holistic view of the table.  Rather, it   merely measures how efficient your discard is by how many tiles it   believes would improve your hand to tenpai, and nothing else.  You have   great efficiency if you can consistently score 95% or higher on this   over several attempts.</p>

    <h1 id="">Counting Points</h1>
    <p>This   is one of the more tedious parts of mahjong. Of course counting points   is automatically done for you in video games, but it's still an   essential thing to learn for players wanting to get into the game   seriously. Not only does it help you save face in irl games, you can   also calculate what kind of hand you must get for that comeback. <a href="https://dainachiba.github.io/RiichiBooks/"><strong>Riichi Book 1</strong></a> has a good section on scoring techniques so go check that out first.</p>

      <p>The Japanese Mahjong Wiki has a good guide on scoring. Below is the translated cheat sheet from the page. </p>

      <p>This one's entirely in Jap, but it's a good resource</p>
      <p>First one indicates riichi (立直), second either tsumo (ツモ) or ron (ロン), next the dora indicator tile (ドラ表示牌), and the last shows the uradora indicator tile (裏ドラ表示牌). なし means none. From there just choose from the dropdown answers below.</p>
