                        <p>Mahjong is a tile-based game most similar to a cross between Gin Rummy and Poker.  It was originally created in China, but the popularity spread quickly, and nearly every single area in Asia has its own variant. </p>
                        <p>This <del>pastebin</del> article is focused solely on the Japanese variation, most commonly known as "Riichi" or "Reach" Mahjong.</p>

The Basic Video Guide is cut into bite-sized parts that you can enjoy in your own pace, while the Extensive Video Guide covers almost everything about the game and is about 3 hours long. Take note that these guides focus more on IRL mahjong, and some aspects like scoring is handled by all mahjong clients.

The interface is fairly stylish, the music is pretty   good, and it allows you to spam emotes from kawaii waifus. There is a gacha game attached to it so you can change out the waifus and their outfits, but everything relating to Mahjong itself is free and is working fairly well.</p>
                            <p>The English and Chinese servers are merged and separated from the Japanese Servers up until the Silver Rooms, and Gold above has all three servers merged.</p>

But unlike majsoul, the game is far kinder when it comes to it's gacha system, with tons of free rolls (which you can use ro reroll for whoever strikes your fancy), cosmetics, and a mathematically higher chance of getting something useful. Sadly, it has no english translations as of this moment.</p>

                              <p>This one's entirely in Jap, but it's a good resource</p>
                              <p>First one indicates riichi (立直), second either tsumo (ツモ) or ron (ロン), next the dora indicator tile (ドラ表示牌), and the last shows the uradora indicator tile (裏ドラ表示牌). なし means none. From there just choose from the dropdown answers below.</p>
