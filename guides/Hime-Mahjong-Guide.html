      <p><strong>Hime Mahjong (雀姬/姫麻雀)</strong> is yet another gatcha mahjong client, on the same vein as mahjong soul. It doesn't have an English Translation (yet). Some say the hime devs employ less jewish methods than majsoul's horrible rates. Sadly, it doesn't have a browser version, only steam and android/iOS.</p>
  <p>The interface is pretty straightforward, and if you're familiar with mahjong you'll can easily make your way through.</p>
  <p>Interesting to note is that there's only one currency in Hime Mahjong, the gold coins. No copper/jade autism.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The seasonal stuff on the left lasts every quarter. Think of it as the   daily copper quests in MahjongSoul except slightly more annoying   (requirements like chi X amount of times or riichi X amount of times are   present but they're usually things like play X amount of ranked games).   Every time you fill a 'battle link' with 10 of the battle shits you get   free stuff. In addition to daily quests, you can get 15 battle balls by   playing games in casual matches. However, casual matches only include   tonpuusen and sanma.<br>
        <br>
        A 10-roll can be purchased in the shop for   1000 of the gold shits in the upper right. You can get 150 of the gold   shits if you fill out 32 of the battle links for the current season. You   can get more gold shits as you achieve yaku and complete consecutive   daily logins.<br>
        <br>
        I'm sure you can figure out how to join and make rooms on your own</p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>If you enter Ranked/Casual, the first button is for <strong>East Games</strong>, while the second is for <strong>South Games</strong>. From there you enter whatever room your rank allows you to.</p>
