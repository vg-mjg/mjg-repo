        <h1>Before Starting</h1>
    <p>Let's face it; for new   beginners without any background knowledge of mahjong, it would be   impossible to teach them everything about the game in one sitting. So   first you must establish both a time and a place to play mahjong. Only   through constant exposure to the game can anyone learn it thoroughly.   You can try to introduce them to video game mahjong, but some of the   ones I've done that to dropped interest in the game as soon as I left my   eyes from them. As for my example, I meet the kids in the park once   every three days, and I bring snacks along with me to hook them in.</p>
    <p>Try   meeting daily for the best possible results, weekly at most. Establish a   place where you usually place so they can feel at home. You are   probably the only one who has a mahjong set among them, so it takes   dedication in your part.</p>

  <section id="phase-1-a-set-and-a-pair-one-suit">
    <h1>Phase 1: A Set and a Pair, One Suit</h1>
    <p>Just   with the Tibet method, start with a single suit, most preferable pin.   First explain that each tile has 4 copies. Teach them that to win, you   need a set and a pair. </p>
    <p><strong>Explaining a set</strong></p>
    <p>Say   that there are two types of sets: chii and pon (don't introduce kan yet   as it isn't relevant for now). Each set is composed of three tiles.   Chii sets are consecutive numbers, 123, 345, 789, while pon sets are   triplets of the same tile, 111, 444, 888. Show this on the table for   maximum effect. I find it nice to use the Japanese terms immediately so   they can get used to proper calling later on.</p>
    <p><strong>Explaining a pair</strong></p>
    <p>A pair is a pair. Just two same tiles, easy.</p>
    <p>So   you and the rest gets four tiles. Don't play yet; show all the tiles   face up and explain how the game goes. Draw a tile, analyze it, discard.   If you win by drawing your winning tile, say "Tsumo", and when the   enemy drops the winning tile, say "Ron". Do it for a few turns until   everyone gets the hang of it, and start playing! No calling, no kans, no   yaku, only tsumo and rons. Just keep playing until everyone understands   the concept of a set and a pair.</p>
  </section>
  <p> </p>

  <section id="phase-2-two-sets-and-a-pair-one-suit">
    <h1>Phase 2: Two Sets and a Pair, One Suit</h1>
    <p>Up   the difficulty by adding another set. This time, everyone gets 7 tiles.   Nothing new here really, just letting everyone get used to saying ron   and tsumo. If you think everyone can understand sets and pair, you can   move on to the next harder phase that introduces new rules...</p>
  </section>
  <p> </p>

  <section id="phase-3-two-sets-and-a-pair-two-suits----basic">
    <h1><a name=""></a>Phase 3: Two Sets and a Pair, Two Suits -- Basic</h1>
    <p>Now   add the bamboo tiles to the pile. It is at this point we reveal that   you need a yaku to win. This part WILL TAKE TIME, but if mastered will   lay the foundation for their future mahjong career.</p>
    <p>Say   that now, it's possible to call other people's discards to finish a   set. Demonstrate a chii (23 chiis 4, 57 chiis 6) and say you can only do   that for the player to your left, while a pon completes a triplet and   can be called from anywhere.</p>
    <p>But you can't just call,   you need a yaku, a certain state of your tiles/however you want to   explain it. But you're not about to unload the full package. No, you're   just going to introduce three:</p>
    <p><strong>Tanyao (All Simples)</strong></p>
    <p>If you call, you shouldn't have any 1 or 9 in your tiles. Your hand can only be composed of 2 to 8.</p>
    <p><strong>Chinitsu (Full Flush)</strong></p>
    <p>But if you want to call for 1 and 9, then this is the yaku to go. All your tiles must be of the same suit, either bamboo or pin.</p>
    <p><strong>Riichi (Reach)</strong></p>
    <p>But   if you can't satisfy any of the above, then you can't open your hand.   So this is the only yaku available for you (yes, Menzen Tsumo is a yaku,   but that'll only confuse them). Just keep your hand close, and when   you're one tile away from winning (DEMONSTRATE, this is hard for many to   understand), call riichi for that yaku requirement. YOU CAN ONLY DO   THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT CALLED. Turn your tile sideway and shout RIICHI for   maximum effect.</p>
    <p>Try some example games.   If they've mastered these three yakus, good for them! If you want,   introduce chiitoi and toitoi slowly in between games (DON'T HIT THEM   WITH CHIITOI, TOITOI, OR WHATEVER YAKU WITHOUT TEACHING THEM FIRST).   Then junchan. We'll get into close hands yaku later. Keep playing until   everyone gets a hang of Riichi in particular and the other yaku   mentioned.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <section id="phase-4-two-sets-and-a-pair-two-suits----advanced">
    <h1>Phase 4: Two Sets and a Pair, Two Suits -- Advanced</h1>
    <p>This part is suited more for 3p  At this point, we'll introduce scoring, dora/uradora and kans.   "But anon, I can't even score my own hands, how can I teach others   that?" No, what we are first going to do is to use a very rudimentary   version of scoring just for everyone to get used to scores:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 han = 1000 points.</li>
      <li>5 han = Mangan, 8000 points</li>
      <li>6-7 han  = Haneman, 12,000 points</li>
      <li>8-9-10 han = Baiman, 16,000 points</li>
      <li>11-12 han = Sanbaiman, 24,000 points</li>
      <li>13 han = Kazoe Yakuman, 32,000 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's   all. No fu, no dealers. Just some plain old scoring for everyone to get   used to it. This is to get them used to the fact that more yaku = more   wins. Each yaku has a certain amount of han:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Riichi</strong> = 1 han (double riichi = 2 han, one shot = +1 han)</li>
      <li><strong>Tsumo</strong> = 1 Han (Explain that if your hand is closed and you draw your winning tile, that's a yaku worth 1 han)</li>
      <li><strong>Chinitsu</strong> = 2 han if hand is open, 3 han if hand is closed (With only two suits, just consider this a honitsu for now)</li>
      <li><strong>Tanyao</strong> = 1 han</li>
      <li><strong>Chiitoi</strong> = 2 han</li>
      <li><strong>Toitoi</strong> = 2 han</li>
      <li><strong>Junchan</strong> = 2 han open, 3 han closed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If   possible, you should print it out/write it down with explanations for   everyone so they can follow the game without that much memorization. The   point is for everyone to recognize the basic yaku as much as possible.</p>
    <p>For points, start with something simple, like 12,000 points</p>
    <p>Time   to introduce dora. Make a dead wall tile of 6 tiles long and 2 tiles   high. Flip the dora indicator and show that each tile after it gives you   1 han.</p>
    <p>Explain kan sets. A kan is composed of four   of the same tiles, and is considered a set. If you have a triplet and   someone drops the 4th tile, calling an open Kan makes you draw a tile   from the dead wall (if you win with that tile, it's another 1 han) and   lets you flip another dora indicator after your discard.</p>
    <p>If   you have four of the same tile in your hand, you can call a closed kan.   You immediately flip the dora indicator and you draw a tile from the   dead wall.</p>
    <p>Then after that, talk about the benefits   of Riichi. Riichi not only gives you a yaku, but also (1) earn an   additional han if your get your winning tile in the first turn [One   Shot]. Not only that, you get to flip the tiles underneath the open dora   indicator for extra dora points! Of course, before you riichi, you bet   1000 points in the table first.</p>
    <p>As they get used to this, introduce some new yaku as well, and distinguish from closed and open hands:</p>
    <p><strong>NEW OPEN HAND:</strong></p>
    <p><u>Pure Straight:</u> a hand that has 123, 456, 789 sets of one suit. </p>
    <p><strong>CLOSED HANDS:</strong></p>
    <p><u>Pinfu:</u> If all your sets are chiis, and you have a two sided wait (34 waiting   on 2 and 5 as an example), then that's 1 han. You can win even without a   riichi.</p>
    <p><u>Pure Double Straight:</u> 112233 pattern. Basically twice of the same chii set.</p>
    <p>Just   keep playing until everyone gets used to scoring. Tell them that this   isn't actually how you score hands, and that actual scoring in Japanese   Mahjong is a lot harder since even a 3 han hand can reach up to a mangan   in certain conditions.</p>
    <p>AND KEEP REMINDING THEM THAT YOU NEED A YAKU TO WIN!</p>
  </section>
  <p> </p>

  <section id="phase-5-three-sets-and-a-pair-three-suits">
    <h1>Phase 5: Three sets and a pair, Three suits</h1>
    <p>If   you think everyone is ready to get to the next level, then add the man   tiles. Let them memorize what each tile is (no need if you've got   numerals on it). Quiz them for a bit. Now, introduce the yaku 3 suited   straight (sanshoku doijin) of 1 han, amd 3 suited triplet (sanshoku   doukou) of two han. Bump Chinitsu to 5 han open/6 han close. Just keep   playing and let everyone get used to the flow of the game. At this point   they've got a pretty good idea of how the game works.</p>
    <p>It is at this point best to introduce furiten. Explain the two furitens, permanent and temporary.</p>
    <p><strong>Temporary:</strong> You can't ron if one of your waits is dropped and you didn't/couldn't ron. Refreshed when it becomes your turn again.</p>
    <p><strong>Permanent:</strong> if one of your winning tiles is in your discards, then you can't ron at all. Only tsumo. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>(ignore riichi furiten for now)</p>
    <p>I   think this is the best time to introduce seat rounds. East, South, West   then North. Maybe show the wind tiles and use them as seat markers for   everyone to get used to it. Don't need to memorize the order, do that   for everyone: they'll familiarize with it sooner or later. East is   always dealer, and they get 1.5 times the points. Each player gets a   chance to become East, and if they win, they get to repeat (Explain   honba for later). So a 2 han hand becomes a 3000 points hand, 5 han   becomes 7500 points and what not. EAST IS ALWAYS DEALER, THE ROUNDS   ROTATE UNTIL WE GO FULL CIRCLE.</p>
    <p>Add some red 5s if you haven't already for them bonus points.</p>
  </section>
  <p> </p>

  <section id="phase-6-the-three-dragons">
    <h1>Phase 6: The Three Dragons</h1>
    <p>We're   so close to actual mahjong. This time, introduce the three dragons:   Green, Red and White dragons. Explain that these dragons can't chii, but   only pon and kan. Also, the order is important for the dora. A good   technique for memorizing this is that it goes down the alphabet:   (G)reen, (R)ed, (W)hite, then back.</p>
    <p>It's only at this   time we introduce the yakuhai yaku. A pon of these dragons will give   you a yaku you might need to win. DEMONSTRATE.</p>
    <p>With the inclusion of the dragons, finally clear up the chinitsu/honitsu yaku and their difference. Show them a <a href="images/reference/yaku_list.png">yaku chart</a>. EXPLAIN THAT THEY AREN'T ALLOWED IN TANYAO.</p>
    <p>The dead wall is now a proper 7-tile distance. Hooray.</p>
    <p>If you want, introduce the Yakumans possible. It's fun to dream after all.</p>
    <p>And   if you think you're confident enough, introduce the proper scoring   method. Give them a scoring app if possible. In the case of my kids in   the park, I didn't introduce it until the very end of the tutorial   because none of them had phones. Plus, the actual math needed is too   advanced for them (they were about 8-12 years old).</p>
    <p>Once they're used to the concept of the yakuhai triplets, it's time to bring out the big guns...</p>
  </section>
  <p> </p>

  <section id="phase-7-winds">
    <h1>Phase 7: Winds</h1>
    <p>I   think winds is the hardest part to teach. But if you did the winds   round from Phase 5, it should go down a bit easier since they are a bit   familiar with them. Just like the dragons, they can only form pons and   kans.</p>
    <p>Then explain yakuhai. A pon of the current round wind or your seat wind will give you a yaku, anything else is useless.</p>
    <p>Shove   the yaku chart on their face. Shove it hard. They know most of them   already, but just let them revel in how much they've gone through.</p>
    <p>At   this point, you might as well play a REAL game of mahjong.   Congratulations. You can teach them how to actually score hands once   they're comfortable.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="final-phase-refining">
    <h1>Final Phase: Refining</h1>
    <p>It   might have taken a few several days, but now everyone is invested in   the game itself after putting so many hours on it, plus they have a   solid foundation to learn the more nuanced rules of Japanese mahjong.   Also, you don't have to follow this guide phase-by-phase; depending on   everyone's learning speed, you might kick it up a notch. I don't   recommend it though.</p>
  </section>
  <p>There might be some things I missed. All in all, just teach by feel nyaa.</p>
