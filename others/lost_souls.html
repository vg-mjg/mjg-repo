  <div class="de1">============================</div>
  <div class="de1" id="1">1=== What's in it for Riu? =</div>
  <div class="de2">============================</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Back in the day it used to be customary for maids to  take care of their young masters' sex ed.</div>
  <div class="de1">Parents would hire attractive girls specifically to pop   their son's cherry. There would be no virgin aristocrats by the age of   14.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">People say Kaavi is the greatest shotacon among the MJS   congregation, but they are wrong. Kaavi is just a professional witch   and young boys' semen is the substance most rich in life force she needs   to work. Shotacon is a work-related necessity for her. She just grabs   what she sees and cares little about consequences in her usual   nihilistically fatalistic manner. No, she is not the greatest shotacon.   Riu is. This young maid enjoys introducing even younger boys to the   adult world. She hunts her prey for the thrill of it and makes sure to   keep up the appearances and genuinely cares about her partners'   experience.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She takes care of Chiori not because she enjoys it. On   the opposite — she hates it. That brat is obnoxious, loud and spoiled.   However, this arduous job has its perks few people apart from Riu could   appreciate. She has met many prime shotas thanks to Chiori. Chiori   thinks she is old enough to go to school and back on her own, but Riu   insists on keeping her company nonetheless. All the boys in Chiori's   school absolutely adore Riu and those old enough to be aware of their   instincts wish to go on a date with her. The girls, on the other hand,   disliked her at first for drawing all the attention to herself. Little   girls in plain uniforms do not really stand a chance against a fully   formed young beauty with a wardrobe of alluring dresses. But ultimately   she has managed to appease their envy by sparing some time to teach them   some tips and tricks on being a proper lady.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">From time to time she would forget that Chiori had   extracurricular activities planned and arrive a bit too early and play   with the kids.</div>
  <div class="de2">They would play card games and bet dares. Nothing   extreme, very tame dares, actually. When Riu won, she would dare the   loser to do some sit ups (while holding their feet), or to endure 10   seconds of tickling, or wear their shirt backwards till the end of the   game. When Riu lost, which happened rather rarely, it was usually to one   of her favorites. The most popular dare asked from Riu was a hug.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Teachers welcomed her at school, especially the male   teachers who would invite her to the office to take some rest from the   kids over a cup of tea. And they were always amazed at Riu's dedication   to entertain the kids and help some of them study. Some parents even   asked her to tutor their struggling children and she usually obliged,   since she had to tutor Chiori either way and knew the school program by   heart.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">==================</div>
  <div class="de2" id="2">2=== Riichi cafe =</div>
  <div class="de1">==================</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu has not always been that way. It is actually quite a sad story how she developed this affinity for younger boys.</div>
  <div class="de1">When she was 17, she took an odd job at a cosplay cafe /   mahjong parlor LULLABY owned by a middle aged man. The bartender at the   place was a college sophomore Natsuki. The fellow was bright, kind and   on top of that handsome. He knew his way around the customers and always   had a story to cheer up even the most desperate late-night visitors.   Half the regulars frequented the place to see Natsuki, actually, and if   he had any ambition he would have quit college and start his own bar.   The clients would have followed him, that's for sure.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">One of such clients was Chiori. Her mother used to take   her there once in a while before she started on her tenure track.   Natsuki recognized rich customers from the first glance and always   served the most extravagant (and overpriced) suandaes and milk shakes to   Chiori while entertaining the mother. As Chiori grew older, she started   competing for attention to the point of embarassing her mother. One she   threw a massive tantrum when Natsuki laughed at mother's joke.</div>
  <div class="de1">"That joke is not funny, and you know it" — she sulled</div>
  <div class="de1">"Pardon me?" — Natsuki turned his head towards Chiori</div>
  <div class="de1">"My mother is married, you know? Why are you laughing at her jokes? Are you flirting with her?"</div>
  <div class="de2">"Oh, I just find it curious, how one of missis Mikami's   students thought that left shift means smearing blood samples from   right to left" — he tried to defuse the situation. — "Do you perhaps   want to tell us an anecdote yourself?"</div>
  <div class="de1">"Her story boring, and your laugh is fake!" — Chiori   wouldn't calm down. — "You want a funny story? Alright! Do you know that   my mother had 2 abortions before I was born? Isn't it funny, huh?"</div>
  <div class="de1">Silence filled the stand. Some of the other customers   let out a surprised whistle. And Chiori just was just sitting there with   a big cocky smug over her face. Mother squeezed Chiori's arm white and   silently pulled her toward the exit.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Heey, what are you doing? I don't want to go! You can leave, if you want to! I will stay here!"</div>
  <div class="de1">"I will talk to you later at home, now move!" — muttered the mother dragging resisting Chiori.</div>
  <div class="de2">The drive home was long, heavy and silent. As soon as   they the apartment door closed, mother gave Chiori two massive slaps in   the cheeks. A hysterical tyrade followed filled with tears and screams.   When father came home, there was a second round of disciplinary   shouting. Chiori received silent treatment which lasted a whole month   and was lifted only after the parents returned from a conference in San   Diego. Needless to say, Chiori was never taken out to LULLABY again.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">========================</div>
  <div class="de1" id="3">3=== Into the maidness =</div>
  <div class="de1">========================</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">The damage was done and the parents realized that their   neglect produced a spoiled cruel brat. Chiori project was deemed a   failure and both of them grew distant, preferring to let a family   friend's daughter take care of her most of the time. So, Riu moved in   with Chiori and became her part-time maid. </div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">It didn't take long for Chiori to figure out that noone   had told Riu why she had been abandoned by her parents, and she didn't   hesitate to exploit this fact. Chiori taught Riu how to play mahjong and   during one game casually dropped that there was a mahjong parlor / cafe   on her way from school where all waitresses were dressed just like Riu.   This indeed sparked Riu's interest and the next evening they headed   towards LULLABY, just in time to witness the very start of Natsuki's   shift.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Sure, Natsuki recognized Chiori as soon as she entered,   and so did the owner. The owner was on his way across the hall to   explain to Chiori that she was barred from this establishment, but   Natsuki stopped him by stretching his arm in front of the owner.</div>
  <div class="de1">"I don't think we need to do that boss. I am sure she has learnt her lesson now" — assured Natsuki, eyeing Riu from afar</div>
  <div class="de1">When the visitors set themselves at the counter, Natsuki approached them to take the order.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Hi Natsuki! Please meet Kujou Riu — she is my maid. Dad gave her to me and now we live together!"</div>
  <div class="de1">"Greetings, miss Mikami. I believe mister Mikami is   quite pleased to have three beauties meet him from work" — said Natsuki   looking Riu deep in the eye.</div>
  <div class="de2">Riu looked down:</div>
  <div class="de1">"Pleased..." - Riu started a tone too high, then cleared her throat - "Pleased to make your acquaintance, mister Natsuki" </div>
  <div class="de1">"Ah, no, Natsuki. You got it all wrong!" — Barged in   Chiori. — "Mom and dad are on a business trip, and now it's just me and   Riu. I think they will be back in a month... or was that two months? Who   cares!"</div>
  <div class="de1">"Missis Mikami will be visiting us next Friday, young   lady. She would like to make sure that your apartment is tidy and you   are taken proper care of" — Riu reminded Chiori. The actual reason for   the meeting, however, was not motherly concern but the necessity to give   Riu her first salary.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Oh, I am most certain missis Mikami will be fully   content with this inspection. If miss Kujou was not working for you,   miss Mikami, LULLABY would welcome her. It is almost impossible to find   such a delicate and diligent maid these days. Or maaaybe..." — he   squinted. — "Miss Mikami, would you like perhaps to become a maid   yourself? What do you say, miss Kujou? If this young beauty joined our   staff, we might not need a happy hour in the afternoon. People will be   flocking just to catch a glimpse of her, hahaha!"</div>
  <div class="de2">Natsuki and Riu burst out laughing, while Chiori   timidly blushed. Was he joking? Or maybe he did feel that way? For the   first time in her life a man other than her dad called her a beauty. Or   was he just flattering a customer? Is that what her mom felt while   talking to Natsuki? This new vague emotion confused her. But finally,   she managed to compose herself.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Me? A maid?! That's ridiculous! What would that make Riu here? A maid's maid? Hee-he"</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">After this warm introduction Riu and Chiori spent a   wonderful evening. They enjoyed their drinks and food, and even played   some mahjong with other customers and maids. Riu liked the place, liked   talking to other maids about fashion, liked the clientele but most   importantly — she was utterly charmed by Natsuki. On their way home, Riu   made a decision.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Young lady, thank you for showing me this place. May I ask your permission?"</div>
  <div class="de2">"For what?"</div>
  <div class="de1">"If you do not mind, I would like to take the afternoon   shift at LULLABY. I could cook and do housekeeping in the morning, then   go to LULLABY and after school we could meet right there. If you wish,   we could play mahjong there or head home right away".</div>
  <div class="de1">Chiori did not respond immediately as if she was giving it some time to roll over.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Fine!" — She exclaimed, Riu gleefully clapped her   hands. — "You should be grateful, you know? I won't tell mom or dad and   you shouldn't either, or they'll think you are slacking off"</div>
  <div class="de1">"I am deeply grateful to have an understanding mistress such as you, young lady"</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Next day Riu applied to LULLABY and became a cafe maid,   working for 4 hours from 2pm until Natsuki's shift started. She was   looking forward to working at LULLABY and spending the evenings with   Chiori and Natsuki.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">===========================</div>
  <div class="de1" id="4">4=== Traumatic experience =</div>
  <div class="de2">===========================</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Since then Riu's life was filled with pleasant routine.   Breakfast with Chiori in the morning, chores, a short walk to LULLABY,   work, leisure time playing majong with Chiori and chatting with Natsuki,   walk home. Every 3 days she did night laundry and ironing to save   energy. Her schedule at LULLABY was 2/2 — the same schedule as Natsuki.   On her days off from LULLABY she would help Chiori with her homework or   go to Harajuku, or visit parents every two weeks. She was as happy as   ever and knew it. These were the good old days she would be referring to   later in life. She didn't need any secondary high school, whe was 17   and doing just fine on her own. A model agent might spot her at the   cafe, if she was lucky, who knows. If not that, she could become a   professional maid. She was already building her resume with 2 jobs. In a   year or two, she could become a real maid in a mansion full of refined,   rich people. Suck on that, dad!</div>
  <div class="de1">And when she gets older, and Natsuki graduates, he will   build a career, and she will be his wife and they will start a family   and have 3 children she will love and cherish. Of course, she'll have to   stop working to take care of her household, but by that time Natsuki   will earn enough to support them all alone. Ah... What a future!</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">That day Chiori was visiting her parents for Christmas,   but Riu decided to stay in town to pull double shifts at LULLABY. With   Mikamis taking care of their own spawn themselves, she desperately   needed extra income. Luckily, the cafe itself was almost empty these   days since most customers went to see their relatives as well. The flow   was so low actually, that only she and Natsuki were enough to cover it.   So it was arranged that only the two of them would handle LULLABY for   the Christmas eve while he was gone with his family to Okinawa.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">After the last lonely customer finished his desert and   left, Natsuki suggested to close early. He locked the front door from   the inside, lowered the roller and went back to help Riu lift all the   chairs before the final clean-up. Riu's heart was pounding hard: she   decided that she would ask Natsuki out as soon as they finished the   shift. It seemed like he, just as her, was not busy, so the risk of   failure was low, right? But although the time has come, she could not   gather the courage to say the words she had been picking for weeks.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Natsuki approached her from behind and put his hand   over hers, while she was cleaning the bar stand. Startled she looked   around and as soon as she turned Natsuki pushed his face into hers to   give a kiss. She stood petrified not knowing how to process what just   happened. After it was over, she could only exclaim:</div>
  <div class="de2">"Whaaaat?!"</div>
  <div class="de1">"Shh...shh...Riu, don't make a fuss about it"</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Somehow, Natsuki was different. Always upright, he was   uncommonly hunched now. His calm smile gone, tension filled his face.   That was not the Natsuki she knew, neither the one she wanted to go out   with. Having gathered her racing thoughts, she started to feel in   danger. She tried backing off, but Natsuki's grip on her arm grew   stronger.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">"Lllet go! You're hurting me!"</div>
  <div class="de1">"Don't fight me, girl!" — he hissed through clenched teeth as he tried to pull her in.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">But Riu did try to clumsily fight back. She scratched   Natsuki's arm and he released his grip. He took a split second to look   at the white scractch marks soon to fill with blood.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Alright, Riu. You want it the hard way, huh?"</div>
  <div class="de2">Riu reached the back door and was frantically pushing on the knob, when Natsuki shouted from the hall.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Hey, I think you left the keys on the counter, honey" — he lauhed.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu was panicking. She was locked in with a violent monster. She started kicking the lock hoping it would give in.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Heey..." — Natsuki peeked over the corner into the dim back corridor.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu stopped and turned to him.</div>
  <div class="de2">"Stop right there or I screm"</div>
  <div class="de1">"That will not help you, " — he whispered while inching in — "You know perfectly well, how few people are around at the moment"</div>
  <div class="de1">"Stop!"</div>
  <div class="de1">"No"</div>
  <div class="de1">Natsuki leaped at her, they both lost balance and were   now lying on the floor. Natsuki's hands were rummaging in the darkness   among the frills of Riu's dress.</div>
  <div class="de2">"Ppleese, noo" — cried Riu</div>
  <div class="de1">Natsuki puched her in the stomach in response. The   numbing pain filled her, she tried to scream but couldn't breethe in.   She let out a silent wheeze and focused on the burning gurgling inside   her chest. For a few seconds she was completely disoriented and thought   she'd die. But as the pain was going away, she remembered what was going   on.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Nooo, nooo" — she repeated much more weakly</div>
  <div class="de1">But Natsuki didn't hear her. He had pulled up her dress   which now covered her head. He was tearing through her pantyhose in   blind lust, painfully pinching her skin in the most delicate places. He   grabbed both Riu's wrists with one hand and pushed them into the floor.   In the darkness of the corridor she could not see what was happening,   but she could hear Natsuki puffing loudly and feel that he was holding   her panties aside. Finally, he entered her. Natsuki was rough and Riu   was feeling sore. All she wanted now was it to end fast, but Natsuki   kept thrusting. At some point the pain started to fade and Riu realized   she was finally gettting moist. On the one hand, this eased her pain.   But on the other, the pleasure she started to feel only made the lump in   her throat grow even heavier. This physilogical reaction filled her   with humiliation and guilt. Each thrust Natsuki bumped hardly into her   erect clit. She anticipated the bolt of pain and a subsequent short   aftertaste of pleasure which came with it. Unable to process her   conflicting feelings, she started to weep.</div>
  <div class="de1">"See, I knew you'd like it, cosplayer whore" — Natsuki   leered in the darkness and adjusted his pose so that his pubis would   constantly be rubbing against her clit.</div>
  <div class="de2">"Yeee, you like it! You are so hot and wet now. I like it too!"</div>
  <div class="de1">He stopped for a moment and leaned closer to Riu's   body. He pulled down her dress and with a swift jerk undid her top. He   felt around under her cotton blouse for a few seconds before fixing his   hand on Riu's right brest. As he painfully twisted it, he reentered and   Riu let out a loud moan. He put his other hand on Riu's shoulder and   pushed her down with all his weight increasing the amplitude of his   thrusts. Shortly after he suddenly stopped and put his head into Riu's   chest. He nibbled onto her nipples while feeling the brests from the   sides.</div>
  <div class="de1">Finally, he stood up and Riu couldn't help but focus   her sight on the black silhouette of her rapist's erect penis against   the white frame of the corridor end.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Come here, Riu, come" — Natsuki beckoned her.</div>
  <div class="de1">She wanted to stand up, but felt so weak she could barely move her limbs.</div>
  <div class="de2">"Ooooh, you stupid whore!" — Natsuki stepped forward and bent over to grab her by the hair.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Come on, you've been a good slut so far. It will soon be over"</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu was no longer paying much attention to what he was   saying. The hot bruises on her breasts, thighs and belly, cracking   shoulder, burning pain between the legs... She was just enduring this.   Natsuki dragged her to the wall and leaned against it.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Now suck it" — he said and Riu felt his hot and hard dick touch her cheek, — "Open your mouth!"</div>
  <div class="de1">Natsuki shook her head violently and Riu obeyed.</div>
  <div class="de2">He forced his dick inside her soft mouth and started   moving as fast as ever. Riu gagged and coughed and pushed her hands   against Natsuki's lap, but he only tugged harder. At last he stopped   moving, and suffocating Riu felt his sperm filling her mouth and oozing   down her throat. He stayed inside Riu for a few moments in perfect bliss   as Riu herself was thrashing around in near-death despair.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">His knees trembling, Natsuki finally let Riu out and   slided down the wall to bathe in his orgasmic ecstasy. Riu quickly   realized she had her chance to escape and shakingly stood up and hurried   back in the main hall. She found the second key under the counter,   grabbed her coat and without taking the time to fix herself, ran past   Natsuki back to the back door.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Hey, Riu..." — Riu was trying to fit the key in the keyhole, but failed every time.</div>
  <div class="de1">"...you know," — continued Natsuki while standing up and zipping his pants.</div>
  <div class="de2">He started approaching her, and in total panic Riu   threw the keys on the floor and let out a series of short high pitched,   tearful screams. Natsuki stopped for a second, then reached for the keys   and helped her open the door.</div>
  <div class="de1">"Just as I promised, it is now all over" — he opened the door and the dim alley lamps lit the usual smile on his face.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu looked him in the eye and rushed out of LULLABY never to return.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">=================</div>
  <div class="de2" id="5">5=== Time heals =</div>
  <div class="de1">=================</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Back at Chiori's apartment Riu took a long extremely   hot shower. She kept examiningall the "love" marks Natsuki gave to her.   She most probably would not be able to wear any revealing clothes for a   fotnight. From time to time she would poke at the black bites on her   nipples to discover yet again how painful they were. She was wondering   how painful it must have been at the moment, since just touching them   now made her flinch. Although she was raped less than an hour ago, the   memories started to fade already. She tried to remember what exactly   happened to her, but her recollections were just a mess of chaotic   details, just like the pile of clothes lying on the bath rug. The dress   was no good anymore. Not that she couldn't fix it, but even if she   tried, she'd never want to put it on again.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">She sat down under the shower and hugged her knees, hot   water cooling over her skid marks. Natsuki... What is wrong with him?   He had always been so sweet and gentle. She actually liked him and   wanted be together. Maybe they would make love eventually, but... Why   would he do that? She wasn't mean to him at all. He spoiled it all! She   slided her hair down the back and looked at her palms blankly.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She slid her hand down the thigh and gently touched her   sore lips. It was not completely painful, if she touched it really   lightly, it was almost pleasant... Just like when Natsuki raped her. It   was not all the pain. There was some pleasure in it. Ye, it was an   interesting emotion. She was in pain and hated everything, but still her   body reacted to give her pleasure. She covered her pussy with the whole   palm, trying to remember the exact sensation she felt.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">But she stopped shortly. She was sure what happened was   wrong and horrible and she would probably never feel safe around men   anymore. It was better to bury these memories. Maybe this way the trauma   would  eventually go away and she could regain her normal state. Swarms   of heavy thoughts were going through her head and she was getting tired   of it. She wiped herself with a warm and fluffy towel and hurried to   her room, where she could soothe her sores with the chill of the fresh   cotton linen.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She slept for almost a whole day, occasionally waking   up and going back to sleep since there was no real reason to get out of   bed. Only when staying in bed became unbearable, she decided to get up   and have a breakfast. She spent the next few days inside when Chiori   called to say she was coming back next morning.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu tidied the place up, did the groceries and prepared the food. Life was going on.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">=======================</div>
  <div class="de2" id="6">6=== Erratic thoughts =</div>
  <div class="de1">=======================</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">The winter holidays were over and Riu was back to her   usual routine, minus her waitress work. Now she was spending more time   with Chiori and they even visited LULLABY occasionally. Natsuki acted as   though nothing special had happened, although Riu herself distanced   herself from him each time they met. She never sat at the bar and   usually headed straight for the mahjong table letting Chiori have all   the milkshakes and chat with Natsuki she could handle.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Chiori didn't pay much attention to this change of   moods and took it as a sign that Riu now realized she was inferior. She   actually welcomed Riu's distancing from Natsuki and didn't really care   about the reasons of it.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">In this period Riu also started to come early to take   Chiori from school. While Chiori was still busy, she would make friends   with the kids, play games and talk and help them study. One particular   boy liked her more than other and she could see that. Always there to   greet her first, or showing his drawings, or telling her about the   basketball game where he scored a critical goal. He was desperate to be   her favourite. Riu found the boy's affection cute at first, but then her   thoughts wandered into a dangerous direction.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She liked playing with the boys at school and liked   being in charge for once. Obeying Chiori's orders day by day made her   appreciate more the moments when she was the one commanding happy to   conform youth. She started to phantasize how far she could take the   gentle power she held over these children. She started to masturbate   regularly in bed thinking about the cute and innocent kids she met   earlier that day. It would be so embarassing if anybody learnt what   thought she had. In her mind she was hungrily stripping the clothes from   little boys, licking and playfully biting their soft skin. Another   moment and she was riding their faces, both hands in their short hair.   She wanted to totally dominate these inexperienced boys not just   physically, but also mentally. She wanted confessions and more childish   little presents filled with honest and naive love. She wanted them to   have their first  wet dreams about her. She wanted them to worship her.   This undiluted adoration was what turned her on the most. After   finishing, she would lay in bed thinking how wrong thinking this way   about schoolchildren is and that she probably should stop spending so   much time in Chiori's school. But these moments didn't last long as she   was quick to leap back into the embrace of sexual ecstasy. Her nightly   masturabation sessions were as long as she needed to numb down the guilt   and recollections of her own traumatic experience. After about an hour   of sweating and humping the pillows she would finally feel exhausted   enough to go to sleep, hoping that next morning she would wake up a   different better person.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">But she never did. The itch didn't go away, but only   grew stronger. Her self-control weakening, one day she started to   masturbate right at school. After talking to some sweet child, she went   to a stall and imagined the boy right in front of her, staring down at   her indecent act with an open mouth. When she left the stall, she was   anxious as she suspected that somehow everybody around her would know   what she had been doing just a few minutes ago. But they didn't, and Riu   ultimately developed a habit of masturbating in school stalls.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She wanted to take her fantasies to reality, but there   never was a convenient occasion. Seducing a lucky kid on school grounds   was too risky, and she couldn't just take him to a hotel. But soon   enough, he troubles were over. During a dinner Chiori decided to ask   Riu's advice about a boy she liked, but was too embarassed to go out   with him.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Riu... You are quite popular with boys, aren't you?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Hmmm? Why would you be asking such a question,   mistress Mikami? - Riu was surprised to hear such a personal question   from Chiori.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You know what? Just drop it. - Chiori tried to retreat, but Riu was already curious.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Is there a special someone you like? You should not   be shy to discuss this sort of matter with me. I can always offer you   some advice. - Riu said soothingly, yet a bit anxious.</div>
  <div class="de1">- It's just... Aaaagh! - Chiori rubbed her cheeks   furiosly to gain some courage. - It's just that, there is a boy in my   class... and he is not very smart, so I help him sometimes. I thought,   maybe... - she looked at Riu timidly. - Maybe, he could come to us, so   we could study, maybe?</div>
  <div class="de1">- ...</div>
  <div class="de2">- I mean, you are smart. You could tutor us both, you know.</div>
  <div class="de1">- I would be glad to help your friend, miss Mikami. - she tried to keep a straight face not to provoke Chiori.</div>
  <div class="de1">At first Riu was afraid Chiori would want to get closer   to Natsuki, since they spent so much time together. She felt relieved   that somebody else was occupying her mind now and not that beast. She   was glad for Chiori, but in the night she couldn't restrain herself and   started imagining all the things she could do a younger boy that was   going to come for a visit.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">====================</div>
  <div class="de2" id="7">7=== New plaything =</div>
  <div class="de1">====================</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">The next day after their slightly awkward dinner with   Chiori, Riu took both her and her friend from school. She let them walk   ahead, so they could discuss whatever they wanted without Riu   embarassing them by her presence.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Back at their place, the three quickly opened their   textbooks and started checking the assignments for the day. Riu had   ulerior motive, when the study session started. She actually was happy,   that for once she managed to escape the grip of her depravity. Fantasies   should be just that — fantasies, hidden and suppressed no matter how   alluring they are. Reality is always uglier than fantasy anyway.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">At some point Riu wanted to go make some tea in the   kitchen and give Chiori some alone time with her sweetheart. Chiori,   however, was eager to demonstrate her tea making skills and insisted on   doing that herself as soon as she finished the math quiz she clearly had   no trouble with. Once they were alone, Riu's resolve started to waver.   Sure, reality may turn out to be uglier than fantasy, but she never   really tested this hypothesis. She kept examining the boy and would lip   occasionaly lick her lips while responding to his quetions. She knew   that what she was about to do was wrong on so many levels. She was about   to harass a middle school boy, cross Chiori, probably violate the law.   But as she saw it, it was the only way to find peace. She was just   trying to pop her own bubble, nothing more. All she had to do was go   forward this one time and never do it again and it would be alright, she   would be back to normal. </div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She looked at the boy intensely staring at his study   book trying to figure out a fraction. The decision was made, it was time   to act. She knew exactly how gorgeous she looked in her new maid dress   and how sweet her smell and how soft her skin were. She knew not even an   innocent little boy could resist the temptation, even if he was hardly   aware of his desires yet to manifest. She leaned closer to him, her   heart pounding heavily as she was about to break the taboo. She leaned   closer and whispered in a charming hushed tone:</div>
  <div class="de2">- Aren't these fractions tiring? Would you like to have a small breather? — her hand quietly gliding over his thigh</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">The boy just sat there not knowing how to react. Emboldened by his trance, Riu carried on.</div>
  <div class="de1">Chiori had never boiled tea before, so Riu and her new   toy had plenty of time ahead of them. Riu kept caressing the boy's thigh   each time moving slightly closer to his crotch.</div>
  <div class="de1">- Please relax, aren't you pleased a beauty such as me   pays you this much attention? - she whispered into his ear and gave it a   teasing bite. Then she laughed out loud and took away her hand.</div>
  <div class="de2">- I bet you were wishing for this to happen yourself.   Could it be you became Chiori's friend to get closer to her servant? -   she snickered some more</div>
  <div class="de1">The boy was tense and red as a beet, not knowing what   to do, what was coming next or what all this meant. Was he doing   something wrong? Is that how adults behave? Riu was quick to throw him   off this never-ending loop of thought.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">- Here, - she unfixed the buttons on her dress and opened it reveal a plain beige bra, - It is now your turn to touch me.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">The boy took a look at Riu's open chest. Then sweet the   smell of Riu's shower gel hit him — the smell he would subconsciously   seek for the rest of his life. But he still hesitated to move.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">- You should be more proactive to become a real man, you know? - Riu took his hand and put it between her breasts. - Go ahead</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">The boy curiously slided over the cups of her bra a few times and then tried to put pressure in his touches.</div>
  <div class="de2">- Don't be afraid, I won't be angry if you are more rough</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">He started kneading Riu's breasts through the bra foam   occasionally pinching a nipple. Riu was euphoric. She couldn't believe   playing with someone as clueless as a Chiori's classmate could be so   fun. The boy, having gained some courage himself, pried his fingers   under the bra to feel Riu's hard erect nipples.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">At this point Riu decided to take things one step   further. Without a word she squeezed her hand under the boy's belt to   reach his itchy hot dick.</div>
  <div class="de2">The boy trembled for a moment, when Riu touched it, but   kept playing with her nipples. When she started stroking, however, he   stopped and leaned back on his chair stretching out his tense legs. Riu   herself was in heat and put her other hand beneath the folds of her   dress into the steaming panties.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">- Riuuuu, where did you put that teapot teapot with cats? - shouted Chiori from the kitchen.</div>
  <div class="de1">- Have you checked the windowsill, young lady? - replied Riu trying to suppress heavy breathing.</div>
  <div class="de1">- Ah, yes, here it is!</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">- We should finish soon, dear guest. Chiori will not be   pleased if she sees us like that, - whispered Riu at her partner. With   these words she squeezed his dick harder, she tried to increase the   amplitude of strokes but his pants were in the way. Reluctantly, she   stopped to undo the pants and release the boys little cock. She then   fell on her knees before the boy's chair</div>
  <div class="de1">- This way we will finish sooner.</div>
  <div class="de1">She closed her eyes and put the boys dick inside her mouth, while vigorously rubbing her clit.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">It took just seconds before the boy ejaculated and the   stingy bitter sperm filled Riu's mouth. She was not finished yet, so she   kept masturbating while sucking on the kid convulsing in pleasure.</div>
  <div class="de1">She kept thinking: "This is it, this is it, I gotta   remember it all. I will treasure this moment", while poking the kids   deflating cock with her tongue.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Finally she climaxed, opened her eyes and moved away   from the kid to take a good look at him. He was out of breath, his teeth   clenched and chest quickly moving up and down. It looked as if he was   in pain and was about to start crying. But Riu knew he wasn't. She liked   what she saw. She wiped her lips with the back of her hand and stood up   to give the kid a wet kiss.</div>
  <div class="de1">She found it funny she could make a kid taste his own cum this way. The boy didn't fight it, and eagerly accepted the kiss.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She then fixed her dress and sat back on her seat.   Surprisingly, she didn't feel guilt or fear or anything negative at all.   She liked every part of this new experience and wondered if it was   enough to quell her thirst. She felt proud of leaving such a bright mark   in this boy's life and entertained the thought of what she'd do next to   him, if Chiori wasn't there.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She looked at the boy zipping his pants lovingly and   when their eyes met, she put her index finger to her smiling lips and   gave him a wink.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2"> - Chiori will be back any minute now. She will be   really disappointed in you if you haven't reduced this fraction when she   arrives.</div>
  <div class="de1">The boy grabbed his pencil and hurriedly  went back to work.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Some moments later Chiori entered the room</div>
  <div class="de1">- Heey, Riuu, could you open the window? The air is stifling!</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She stood up and Chiori swiftly took her place to offer her guest a cup of tea.</div>
  <div class="de1">- Ah? You haven't solved this page yet? Jeez, didn't   Riu help you at all? Riu, why didn't you show him how to find a common   denominator while I was gone?</div>
  <div class="de1">- We were covering some other, more fundamental gaps in   that time, young lady. I am sure your guest will have no trouble   figuring out fraction multiplication after our conversation.</div>
  <div class="de1">- Huh?.. I hope you didn't just tell jokes about me, did you? I could hear you laughing back there!</div>
  <div class="de2">- Oh no, young lady, I assure you we did not discuss you at all.</div>
  <div class="de1">- I sure hope so, Riu. Could you please take the tray now?</div>
  <div class="de1">- Most certainly, young lady — Riu put the empty tray under her armit and covertly pinched the boy's ear lobe on her way out.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">In the end, the reality turned out to be much more entertaining than the fantasy.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">=================</div>
  <div class="de1" id="8">8=== Biker girl =</div>
  <div class="de1">=================</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">After Chiori's study date Riu became much bolder in her   actions. Although, she never risked doing anything too extreme with the   kids on school grounds.</div>
  <div class="de1">She did take some tutoring offers, including the one   from Chiori's friend parents. Twice a week she went to their apartments   and taught them math, apart from other others things. She enjoyed her   new toys and fully embraced her desires. Riu was as happy as ever with   her newly acquired status quo.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">But after two months of routinely running warm-up   quizzes with pretty faces between her legs, she encountered the first   troubles such a lifestyle entailed.</div>
  <div class="de1">One day after the school, when Riu was taking Chiori   back home right at the gate there was a young woman in a leatrher   jacket, leaning on a sparkling clean sports bike. She was tall and   emanated stern, almost masculine beauty. Riu's first impression was that   this woman would look absolutely stunning in a classic suit. The   contrast between the brutality of her biker apparel and gorgeous,   waist-long hime-cut crow-black hair made the whole image all the more   intriguing and enticing. Just as they were passing by, the woman stood   up and stepped in their way.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Huh, miss Kujou, pleasure to meet you! — The mystery woman approached her confidently</div>
  <div class="de1">— Pardon me, do I...</div>
  <div class="de1">— No-no, we haven't met. I'm the sister of one of your   students. Oh, hello, little one! — She tilted her head towards Chiori,   grinning. — May I steal your maid for the evening, dear?</div>
  <div class="de1">Chiori pouted and breathed in to put this rude stranger in place, but Riu stopped her by tightening the grip on her hand.</div>
  <div class="de2">— I am sorry, but we are quite busy this evening. Maybe   if you could come to our next study session, then we could talk. Whose   sister are you?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, that's a pity! It's just ** told me about the   extra courses you taught him. I was quite surprised to learn what kind   of things you teach him. I did not expect a young kid to grasp such   grown up concepts. But somehow you managed to explain it all to him well   enough. I just wanted to thank you is all.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu stood there shell-shocked. She knew trusting a   small kid to not spill the beans was risky at best, but she did not   expect to face the consequnces so soon. She was glaring at the biker   woman waiting for her next words.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">— Sure we can talk some other time. But I was passing   by and hoped we could have some coffee, right now — the woman pointedly   articulated the last two words. — So, what do you think? Can your   protegee find the way home alone? — she winked at Chiori.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Young lady, may I ask you for a favor? — Riu asked from Chiori, trying her bes to keep her composure.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Don't mind me, I'll be fine. Go have fun with your fangirl, Riu — she replied smiling as happily as ever.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">With that Chiori marched off, while waving a hand. It   was unexpected, yet pleasant to get a day off from her nanny. Much less   pleasnt times were ahead of Riu.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Now what? — She asked the woman after Chiori was far enough.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Now we hop on my bike, and we go have some coffee, like I said.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Hop on? How am I supposed to do that? — irritatedly exclaimed Riu while shaking her long skirt.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Roll that up, miss fancy dress.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Roll up?!</div>
  <div class="de1">— Well, duh. You can't sit sideways on a bike.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I refuse.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You are not in a position to refuse. I can go to the   principal right this instant. And tell him all the dirty details I know.   You'll be lucky to call your mom before they put your pedo ass where it   belongs.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Don't say that so loud in here!</div>
  <div class="de2">— So what?</div>
  <div class="de1">— ... Do you at least have a helmet?</div>
  <div class="de1">— If I don't need one, you don't either.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Can I at least roll it up behind the corner?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Go ahead. I'll pick you up.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu hurried off to an alcove between the school grounds   wall and a nearby apartment building. She clumsily  tried to gather her   skirt into folds. The roar of an engine announced her new   acquaintance's arrival.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Gosh, hurry up.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I'm trying! — Riu exclaimed while standing up.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Hey, you got nice legs.</div>
  <div class="de1">— What?! — she screamed in disbelief.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Ok-ok, calm down, sheesh. Now get on the seat and hold tight.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She was scared and knew how pathetic she must have   looked. She had tears gathering in the corners of her eyes, as she   realized that now her fate was at the mercy of this reckless, cruel   woman, whose name she didn't even know.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Do you think it is high time you introduce yourself?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Ah, sorry, totally forgot about that. The name is Nadeshiko. Nice to meet you. Now get ON!</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu climbed the seat, hugged Nadeshiko's waist and the   bike rumbled into the city streets. She closed her eyes against the   strong wind, which was drying her tears before they could touch the   ground. She could only hope this day wouldn't get any worse.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">===============</div>
  <div class="de1" id="9">9=== Yes girl =</div>
  <div class="de1">===============</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko and Riu entered a downtown apartment building   and took the elevator to the 5th floor. Riu was too nervous to ask   anything about the place they were headed to, so the elevator was filled   with strained silence.</div>
  <div class="de2">When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a   typical grey-tiled corridor with plain white doors on both sides. Riu   followed Nadeshiko to one of them, turned the key and invited Riu into a   dark room on the other side.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Don't be so nervous, I promise you, it's not half as bad as whatever you are imagining.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu stepped inside and managed to make out the   silhouettes of a few tables and coat stands. The room was much bigger on   the inside than she had expected. Actually, this was a double apartment   with one wall demolished, and the next door was barricaded by a   bookshelf on the inside.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— We still have a couple of hours before this place   opens, — said Nadeshiko while feeling for a switch. — Noone will disturb   us. I will explain your part in a few minutes.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">The switch flicked loudly in the empty room and Riu   could finally clearly see her surroundings. There indeed were tables all   over the place and a bar stand in the deep end. The whole place looked   like a cafe, if not for one quite significant detail. Riu dropped her   jaw in shock and stared at Nadeshiko eyes wide and wet. What she   initially thought were coat stands were actually the racks you'd expect   to see in a rape dungeon.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Nadeshiko looked at Riu for a second bewildered by her   numb and frightened reaction, and then she realized how shocking this   situation must have looked to her.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, hahaha, — Nadeshiko burst out. — Oh, the look on your face. You think I am going to torture you or something, right?</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu's face did not budge.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I told you it would be ok, don't worry, — Nadeshiko   marched towards the bar, each her step ringing coldly across the racks.   — It is nothing like that, seriously. This is just a specialized cafe my   friends run. The clientele is all regular folks with office jobs. They   come here to blow off some steam, y'know. Tie somebody up, or be tied up   by a strong woman in stilettos. It's all legal, by the way. Maybe,   you'll want to take your friends here some day. Just make sure they are   not too young, ok?</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko was explaining while mixing two servings of negroni.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— So, uhm... Welcome, I guess? Do you feel at ease now?   — She continue seeing that Riu's posture became a bit more relaxed,   although still not quite. — Come on, close the door and get in here,   — Nadeshiko said in a soft voice, waving a glass in her hand.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Riu walked toward the stand still guessing why Nadeshiko brought her to this fetish cafe.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Here, help yourself.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Nadeshiko, I don't drink alcohol.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, look at little miss right over here. I insist,   — She drummed on the edge of the tumbler glass with her blue polished   fingernail.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Riu took a sip of negroni, which had a touch too much gin in it and winced.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Huh, you do not drink, alcohol, I guess. Let me help a bit.</div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko gulped from Riu's glass and refilled it with grapefruit juice.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Now, let's talk business. I need your help, Riu.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You want me to... work here?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Huh, fat chance. No, I need your help with something else. You do play mahjong, right?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Yes, sometimes. But I'm not that good at it, — Riu rolled her glass anxiously.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Really? Are you playing shy now? A friend of mine told me you were pro material.</div>
  <div class="de1">— What friend?</div>
  <div class="de1">— It doesn't matter. What matters is that I trust him   more than you. And he assured me, that you, your play level is up to our   standards.</div>
  <div class="de2">— "Our" standards?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Who do you think, I am, Riu? "Our" standards! Damn,   perhaps he was right, cos that's hell of a dumb question you're asking,   — Nadeshiko took a violent sip.</div>
  <div class="de1">— So...</div>
  <div class="de1">— So, I need you help in mahjong. "Our" player dropped   ill, some kind of flu or poisoning... Never mind. He can't play today,   and it is vitally important that somebody represents "us" today, you   understand?</div>
  <div class="de1">— I guess, but I do not understand the "vitally" part.</div>
  <div class="de2">— That means I am giving you the an extremely rare   chance to get away with what you've done. You play six hanchans in   tonight, win, and nobody will ever learn about your shameful tendencies.   You get smarter, stop fiddling kids and move on with your life. Does   this sound good enough for you?</div>
  <div class="de1">— And what if I lose?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Drop that attitude. You will win, full stop. Otherwise, it will not be as pretty. I believe you can imagine that.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu pondered her options for a minute. Not that the   choice was obvious, she has to play. She was painfully regretting her   life choices to this day. If only she could have kept her hands to   herself, or had never took that offer in LULLABY, or had never accepted   being Chiori's maid. Uuuugh. It's all too much. Is that her life now?   Being blackmailed into cooperating with the shady types? What are the   chances Nadeshiko actually lets her go after tonight? And what if she   lost? "It will not be pretty" — what exactly is that? Will they burn her   face with acid or what? Full of doubt but seeing no other way she   replied:</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Nadeshiko, are you really one of my student's sister?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Huh?! You know, I'm starting to have serious doubts about your wits, Riu. I think, I should let you go...</div>
  <div class="de1">— No-no, sorry. I will, I will play tonight, please don't. — she splurted out</div>
  <div class="de1">— Atta girl! And what else will you do tonight for me?</div>
  <div class="de2">— I... will win for you.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That's right! You will win! That's the answer I can take! — Nadeshiko clapped and finished her cocktail in one go.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Will we be playing here?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Ah, not quite, the game is on our turf — just across   the corridor, — she checked her watch. — We still have about an hour to   go, so you can lie down if you want, take some rest.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Will the others be cheating?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Highly unlikely. The room will be packed with   referees from all the parties involved. Nobody in their right mind would   make such a faux pas. Were you going to?</div>
  <div class="de1">— No-no, I don't even know how to cheat.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That's good, because out of all the players I'm sure   you will be the one attracting the most attention, — Nadeshiko smiled   and winked at Riu.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">"Oh god, is she flirting with me?" — Riu thought and blushed heavily.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">================================</div>
  <div class="de1" id="10">10=== Triumph with a city view =</div>
  <div class="de1">================================</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Heavy smoke was filling the room. The air was hard to   breath, but having spent 9 hours in this room, Riu got used to it.   Saying that the tiles were kind to her would be an understatement. They   were kind to her every single hanchan. Kind enough to give her a dealer   yakuman in the second one and six renchans in the 4th. She was   steamrolling the opponents and this final hanchan was no different. The   veteran gamblers at the table were utterly frustrated to be beaten by a   young fragile girl. Not to mention her disgustingly conspicuous   cleavage.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Ron! 12000.— exclaimed Riu finishing the last round of the long-long night.</div>
  <div class="de1">With this ron she managed to climb out of the fourth   place into second. Altogether, she managed to avoid being fourth in all   the six hanchans that night.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">— Not again! You little brat! Think you can ron me like   that! I'll show you ron, get in here! — the middle-aged loser could not   hold back his anger anymore.</div>
  <div class="de1">His final score was humiliatingly low, and given this   was a high-stakes game, he was probably anticipating the unpleasnt talk   with his boss. Two of his colleagues pushed down on his shoulders to   keep him seated.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, shut it! — Replied another player in a less   desperate situation. — You were feeding her all night, it is totally   your fault she's the winner. I am itching to beat your ass myself. Your   pushing right into her hands has disrupted my flow!</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Now, now, gentlemen — Nadeshiko approached the table   through the clouds of smoke. — The session is over and I think it is   time we settle our score. If you want revanche, schedule it with my   associates over there. ...Not that you can afford one.</div>
  <div class="de2">— You filthy, rotten!.. — the sore loser started again.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Uh-huh! — Nadeshiko raised her finger. — Don't say   anything you'll regret later. Your situation is bad as it is, you want   to make it even worse?</div>
  <div class="de1">The loser dropped his head silently.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That's what I thought. Yo, boys, you ready over   there? — she shouted towards the far end of the room where people were   counting and packing cash into sport bags, paying close attention to   each others hands.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Almost there, Nadeshiko. Ready to leave in 2 minutes — shouted one of her associates.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko leaned towards Riu and whispered into her   ear: "Told you it would be alright", and patted her shoulder. Riu no   longer thought about her troubles. The game washed it all away, and she   was diving in the refreshing waves of flow round aftr round. She was   full of joy, steamrolling the seasoned gamblers all around her. Despite   playing for hours on end she did not feel fatigue and was in a mood for   celebration. She moved her hand over Nadeshiko's and stood up.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Thank you for the game, — she bowed to her opponents,   none of which responded back. Then she turned to Nadeshiko, took her   hands and said in a stifled voice. — I had so much fun!</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, get a room already! — said a voice somewhere in the smoke.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You know, maybe we will, — said Nadeshiko, looking   Riu in the eyes. — You there, load the bags in the car. We're off.   Goodbye losers!</div>
  <div class="de2">Nadeshiko pulled Riu's hand outside the room, where she took out her phone to call a driver.</div>
  <div class="de1">— So, what do you say, shall we celebrate?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Huh, you were serious?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Not like that, I mean, there is a place with 24/7   room service. You should try their deserts, they are something out of   this world.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Are you hitting on me? — Riu asked feeling a bit nervous.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Oh, no, nothing like that. I think you did a great   job and we made a lot of money today, so why not splurge some of our   fortune?</div>
  <div class="de1">— You say "our" fortune...</div>
  <div class="de1">— Why, yes. As I said, you did a great job, obviously you deserve a reward.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">The door opened and three associates emerged loaded   with 5 sport bags. Nadeshiko and Riu followed them to the elevator and   outside to a large black Akura. The bags went to the trunk and the   carriers congratulated Nadeshiko and Riu once more on a great game, then   boarded a nearby car.</div>
  <div class="de2">— So, your answer?</div>
  <div class="de1">— About what?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Celebration, are we going to celebrate?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Hm... What is my share from the night?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Hahaha, you seem much more tenacious than back when I met you. I think 20%, one bag is reasonable enough?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Just one bag?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Don't push it, Riu. Remember, you are still on probation! Actually I'm being way to generous with you...</div>
  <div class="de1">— I was just kidding, Nadeshiko. A whole bag of money: how could one possibly decline this? Now let's go!</div>
  <div class="de1">— That's more like it, — smiled Nadeshiko and opened the door for Riu.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Nadeshiko went around the car and boarded from the   other side. The car took off and rather soon they arrived to Marunochi.   Nadeshiko took one bag out of the trunk, and clapped on the rear window   to send off the driver with the rest of the money.</div>
  <div class="de1">They then entered a hotel opposite side of the train   station, where the concierge greeted her as an old familiar and gave her   the key to a room.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Huh, dear Nadeshiko, are you in good spirits today?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Haha,you bet, old crook. We are high rolling today, — she cheerfully replied shaking the heavy bag. — Is the terrace open?</div>
  <div class="de2">— I am sorry, we had a big party on the terrace and the crew is cleaning it at the moment.</div>
  <div class="de1">— It's alright, it's alright. Let me introduce you to master Kujou: she is the best mahjong player in Tokyo as of today.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Pleased to make your acquaintance, miss Kujou. My name is Johny I am the concierge of Marunochi ***. At your service.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu was positively surprised to for once find her self on the other side of high-end service.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Pleased to meet you too, Johny — she replied and full of excitment burst out laughing.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Ah, the youth, so full of joy. Are you two perhaps hungry?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Why, yes, Johny. We would like... — Nadeshiko   exchanged quick glances with Riu. — Two Bollingers, a bucket of those   green shrimps...</div>
  <div class="de1">— Wasabi shrimps, Nadeshiko?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Yes, those. Also some of that duck terrine and grapes.</div>
  <div class="de1">— And cakes, — Riu reminded playfully.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Yes, and Desert Number One for both of us. That's all.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Will be delivered to you shortly, young ladies, — said Johny and went back to his desk to pass the order.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">As the two were making their way across the spacious hall towards the elevators, Riu asked:</div>
  <div class="de1">— Hey, Nadeshiko, what is a Bollinger?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Oh, haven't you tried it before?</div>
  <div class="de1">— No.</div>
  <div class="de1">— After you taste it, it will become your favorite   drink. Luckily, you can afford it any day of the week now, — she shook   her shoulder with the bag strap on it.</div>
  <div class="de1">— But I don't drink, I told you that.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Don't worry, it is very light and fruity, almost like a fizz. I'm sure you'll like it.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">As they moved through the luxury of a highly rated   hotel, Riu felt as if she was a princess in a beautiful castle. She had   never been in such expensive places before and couldn't believe that she   was not only allowed to stay among this extravagance, but was supposed   to enjoy it to the fullest.</div>
  <div class="de1">When they reached the room, Riu was astonished even   more. A glass wall offered a sky line vista of a late night megapolis.   The old train station far below looked tiny in the place, clutched by   skyscrapers. She couldn't hold her excitment and started talking to   Nadeshiko about the beautiful view. The main room had a giant TV on one   wall and a big table next to it, where a dozen of people could make a   conference, while overseeing the city. Riu was running across the rooms   and telling Nadeshiko about all the things she thought were cute,   tasteful or fascinating. The giant bath with steps inside it was   fascinating, its brass faucets were cute, the unusual switches you   needed to turn were extremely tasteful. The king sized bed with dark oak   stands was fascinating, the snow white bedsheets neatly tucked in were   unbelievable, the marble lazy susan in the same room was solid, cute and   crafty at the same time.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— There, there, calm down Riu! — Nadeshiko said, quite   amused by her partner's crazed reactions to the things she considered   mundane background of her everyday life. — You don't regret accepting my   invitation now, do you?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Not at all, Nadeshiko! Thank you for bringing me here.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You know, you could stay in such kind of places more often, if you became our regular player.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, you are all business and no fun. Can't we just   have fun tonight? — Riu leaped towards Nadeshiko and teasingly pressed   her index finger against Nadeshiko's forehead. — If you think too much   about work, these wrinkles will only get worse.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, am I an old lady, is that what you are saying? —   Nadeshiko grabbed Riu, wrist and whirled Riu, as in a part dance, part   fighting move.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu was now standing with her back pressed against   Nadeshiko's soft heaving breasts. Nadeshiko was most definitely hitting   on her, and when she slided her left hand across Riu's belly, Riu   decided to break the tension.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Ah, my fet are so tired. I've been all day in these shoes.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Isn't that so, Riu? Do you think some massage could help? — Nadeshiko would not let her go.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh dear, my dress reeks of tobacco. I think I should   have a shower. I'll be back shortly, — Riu broke free and ran off to the   bathroom.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Some minutes later she went out wearing a white fluffy bathrobe over the naked body.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Ahh, it is so refreshing! Nadeshiko, you should wash off the dust as well.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Maybe some time later. The dinner has arrived, care to join me? — Nadeshiko raised her champagne glass.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu joined Nadeshiko at the lazy Susan and inspected   the champagne buckets on the floor. She lifted the opened bottle, which   already was half empty and poured some into her glass.</div>
  <div class="de2">The girls were enjoying the meal and reminiscing the   events of that night's game.They laughed, and discussed riichi strategy,   the talent of the chef, drank and laughed even more. At some point Riu   thought raised a toast:</div>
  <div class="de1">— Happiness is so evasive, Nadeshiko, but tonight I   feel happy. All my worries are gone. I want to remember this moment   forever, because if all this isn't good times, I don't know what is! To   us, Nadeshiko! May our lives be full of such moments!</div>
  <div class="de1">— To us!</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">After the finished their glasses, the resumed the talk.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Yes, today indeed is a special day. You looked stunning at the table.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Stop it, Nadeshiko.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Why? You really did. So young, fresh and beautiful among those greasy old men.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, you are so sweet Nadeshiko, — Riu smiled and sent her an air kiss.</div>
  <div class="de1">As Riu reached for the grapes Nadeshiko caught her hand.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Do you think I am beautiful too, Riu? — the tension set in the air.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Yes, you are very beautiful, Nadeshiko, — Riu unsuccessfully tried to sheke off her hand.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Prove it.</div>
  <div class="de1">— What?</div>
  <div class="de1">— If you think I am beautiful, then you wouldn't mind kissing a beautiful girl, right?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Whaat? I'm not like that, Nadeshiko, you know.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Would it be better if I were a little boy?</div>
  <div class="de1">— No, gross, Nadeshiko. Is that what you usually do? Lure young girls to a posh suite, get them drunk and try to seduce them?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Is that wrong?</div>
  <div class="de1">— ...</div>
  <div class="de2">— Riu, I honestly like you. It's not that often I bring girls over.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, so I should feel special now?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Listen, if I didn't like you, I'd dropped you right   after the game was over. But I do. You are special, at least to me. I   want to keep working with you, and I think we could make great friends.</div>
  <div class="de1">— But we are girls, Nadeshiko. How is that even supposed to work.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, sweet Riu, you have so much to learn yet.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko stood up and went over to Riu's chair. She   held her cheek and leaned in. Nadeshiko's silky hair engulfed Riu and   they kissed. Riu could taste the champagne in her kiss and surprisingly   enjoyed it. She wanted it to last, but then suddenly Nadeshiko stopped   and stood straight, offering Riu her hand.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Argh, gosh, you win, — Riu took her hand.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Just relax, trust me, you will like it, — Nadeshiko lead Riu towards the bed. — I'll be back shortly.</div>
  <div class="de2">Nadeshiko went off to the bathroom and turn on the   shower. Riu was rolling around the sheets full of hesitation. Sure,   Nadeshiko was stunningly beautiful, and Riu liked her as a person, and   she was extremely kind to her. But she still could never imagine herself   to end up in a situation like this.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">The water stopped and Nadeshiko emerged in the same   bath robe. She went towards the bedroom, stoping by the fridge to take   out a bottle of water.  Eyeing nervous Riu fidgeting on the edge of the   bed, Nadeshiko took a few deep gulps and offered the bottle to Riu.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You should stay hydrated, my dear.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Can you turn off the lights, please? — she said taking the bottle</div>
  <div class="de2">— As you wish.</div>
  <div class="de1">*flick*</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">In the darkness Nadeshiko sat beside Riu and stroked   Riu's hair. Riu still had her mouth attached to the bottle, even when   Nadeshiko was undoing the knot on her robe. Riu moved the bottle and let   out a loud sigh.</div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko proceeded to drop Riu's robe off her shoulders revealing her slender torso.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Even the darkness can't hide your beauty, — Nadeshiko said gliding with the back of her palm over Riu's naked body.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Will you undress yourself? — asked Riu sarcastically.</div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko stood up against the window and the robe   dropped to the ground. In the dim reflection of the street light   Nadeshiko stood framed by her black hair. Riu was inspecting the body of   a woman about to have sex with her, and Nadeshiko was waiting silently.   Riu's heartbeat reverberated in her ears, as she still could not   comprehend the situation she was in. Fortunately, champagne numbed the   burning shame and she finally decided to take a more active role.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu stood up and and entwined her arms around   Nadeshiko. They stood kissing and feeling each other for a minute, when   Nadeshiko lower her hand to Riu's bush. She pushed Riu towards the bed   and lied next to her. Nadeshiko kept rubbing Riu's clit, occasionally   sliding her finger across Riu's slit to scoop up the lubricant. She   lowered her head and started kissing Riu's breasts and slightly nimbling   on her nipples. All the while Riu was sensually moaning and covering   her eyes with a hand, since she despite the pleasure and alcohol   circulating in her system, she still refused to accept this new   experience.</div>
  <div class="de2">At first Nadeshiko's attempt to insert even one finger   failed, but after she increased the tempo Riu loosened up and Nadeshiko   inserted her fingers into Riu's burning slit. She kept rubbing the clit   with her palm and Riu's insides with her index finger. It didn't take   long after that for Riu to reach the climax, and as she was convulsing   in ecstasy, Nadeshiko stopped moving and bit Riu's nipple a bit harder   than usual.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Did you like it?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Huuuh, can't you see?! — exclaimed Riu and rose to give Nadeshiko a long wet kiss to express her gratitude.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You know, I'm still this side of the barricades, — Nadeshiko brought Riu's hand to her own clean-shaven, leaking crotch.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Hehe, I think I could help you with that, — smiled Riu in the darkness and slowly started gliding over Nadeshiko's lips.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I don't think that will do for me, Riu. Lie down.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Why? What are you going to do?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Just lie down, I like it this way.</div>
  <div class="de1">— OK</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu lied down on the back among the ruffled sheets and Nadeshiko climbed on her chest.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Are you serious?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Deadly serious.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You want me to eat you out?</div>
  <div class="de2">Nadeshiko lowered herself onto Riu, pressing their breasts together and whispered into her ears:</div>
  <div class="de1">— If you want me to come tonight, it is the only way, — then she moved back up.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Still hesitating, but eager to return the favor, Riu sighed:</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, Nadeshiko, the things you make me do.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko started riding Riu's face, rubbing the clit   around her nose. Trying her best, Riu sticked out her tongue and started   licking the lubricant off Nadeshiko. Riu wasn't sure if she was doing   it right, but Nadeshiko's muttering "Yes" through clenched teeth   reassured her. Nadeshiko weighing down on her chest made Riu   uncomfortable, but she endured and started inserting her tongue inside   Nadeshiko hoping to speed up this curious, yet slightly humiliating form   of intercourse.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Touch my tits, Riu, I'm getting there, — dropped Nadeshiko pushing harder into Riu's face, making it hard to breathe.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu lifted her hands and started playing with   Nadeshiko's jiggling tits. Quite chaotically, she rubbed them together   and pinched the nipples at the moments she was trying to insert her   tongue as deep as she could. Nadeshiko clenched Riu's head and started   moving so fiercely, Riu could not grasp a single breath. Guessing that   Nadeshiko was soon to come, Riu squeezed her tits and started twisting   her tongue wildly.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">— Oh, yiss, yiss! — screamed Nadeshiko delivering her final, slow swings across Riu's face.</div>
  <div class="de1">Finally she climbed down and showered Riu's body in   kisses, while she was wiping herself with a pillow. Nadeshiko jumped to   lie next to Riu and gave her a tender kiss on the cheek.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You did great Riu. That was fascinating! Honestly, I didn't expect you to be this good.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Well, I didn't know it myself, — she said landing a quick return kiss on Nadeshiko's nose.</div>
  <div class="de1">For a few moments the two stared each other in the eyes, when Riu broke the silence:</div>
  <div class="de2">— It is really strange...</div>
  <div class="de1">— What is? — replied Nadeshiko, rummaging below the bed to find a bottle of water.</div>
  <div class="de1">— When I first saw you, you did not strike me as a type, who would shave down there...</div>
  <div class="de1">— Haha, is that what you think about meeting new people: do they shave down there?</div>
  <div class="de1">— No. It's that: you are so self-confident. But I read   in a magazine, that only the girls, who are getting old and want to look   younger do that.</div>
  <div class="de2">Nadeshiko choked on the water and replied, coughing between her words:</div>
  <div class="de1">— Hey... You.. You say I am... am an old hag again?! — And punched Riu in the leg.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Ouch, no! I don't care about your age, — Riu rubbed the thigh.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh god, — Nadeshiko moved her palm across the face. —   Just stop it already. I'll tell you what: if I didn't shave, your face   would be all red and itchy right now.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You have a point.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu extended her arm asking for water. Nadeshiko gave it to her and flopped down in the pillows.</div>
  <div class="de1">— So, you still haven't touched the desert, — she reminded Riu, putting her hand behind her head.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh right, that's the one you lured me in with.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Yes, Desert Number One, the best, sweetest cake in Marunochi. And after we finish it...</div>
  <div class="de2">— And after that...</div>
  <div class="de1">— And after that we get back to Desert Number Two, — Nadeshiko turned and pinched Riu's nipple.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">=============================</div>
  <div class="de1" id="11">11=== Hazardous environment =</div>
  <div class="de2">=============================</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu stopped taking care of Chiori after that night and   took the regular rep player job Nadeshiko offered her. Her life was full   of exciting gambles, money and expensive experiences. Chiori didn't   seem bothered at all by Riu's abdication. Surprisingly, her parents did   not find a new nanny for her and decided she was old enough to live on   her own. Not that Chiori was against it.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Despite now being an integral part to an illegal and   dangerous operation, Riu was rather reckless. Despite Nadeshiko's   warnings, she kept wandering around the city on her own and flaunting   her wealth buying rounds at expensive bars. Riu's winning streak to get   insultingly long for all the other underground reps and rubbing it in   their faces all around the city didn't help Riu.</div>
  <div class="de1">One day, as she was window shopping downtown, a grey   van stopped nearby and before she knew it, Riu had a gag in her mouth   and was tied up in its dusty interior. Her kidnappers rained on her with   insults and said they were about to teach her a lesson about modesty.   They slapped and groped her and spit in her face. Riu knew things were   bad and she could only hope the imminent rape would not end in a murder.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">When the car stopped, she was kicked out of the side   door into the curb of a dirtroad. The driver was leading the way with a   small coller in his hand, as two other men dragged her by the arms into   the forest. Once far enough, she was cut loose. Riu stood silent,   knowing better than trying to scream for help in the middle of nowhere.   Instead, she started undressing herself, which greatly amused her   kidnappers.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Ey, look at her go guys! All we wanted is just talk   with you, but hey, if you insist, — said the leader handing down the gun   beneath his belt to one of his partners.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Please don't kill me, I'll do anything you want, — begged Riu standing naked on the prickly pine needles.</div>
  <div class="de2">— That depends, girl, on the sincerity of your apology.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I am sorry.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Nah, words won't make it. Go hug a tree for me, Riu.</div>
  <div class="de1">— What?</div>
  <div class="de1">— You said you'd do anything, right? Go hug a tree, — repeated the leader, while the two others kept snickering.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu obeyed and pressed her body against a nearby pine.   The leader approached her from behind and violently pulled her hips   towards him, making her scratch the bark with her naked breasts. Riu was   wondering how long her ordeal would last. Would they be done with her   in an hour? In two? Would they really release her after that or shoot   her down? Was there any hope to survive this at all? She also regretted   deeply being so reckless and not realising the people she was ripping   off at the mahjong table were coal-hearted criminals, who would not   tolerate do much more for much less money she had taken from them.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">The man behind her unzipped his pants and squeezed a   generous amount of lube into his hand. He spread it along his dick and   then pressed the tube against Riu, and then squeezed the cold lube   inside her and then entered her. Riu held her hands against the pine,   when another man came closer and knocked down her arms making Riu lose   balance and hit the tree with her face. Everybody laughed.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">— Hah, Riu, you are a good girl, but a dumb one. I hear   you and Nadeshiko are munching each other's carpets, do you love her?   Answer me! — the man behind Riu grunted.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Yes, yes, we love each other.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You are so dumb Riu. Has she told you, what happened to the her previous player? Has she?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Ah, she got cold feet and ran away.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That's right, you know why?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Nnnoo, — Riu stuttered while being pounded.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That's because we asked her to get out of our way.   Nadeshiko was using her, and now she's using you. She knew we'd get you,   if you kept winning. She doesn't care about you.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That's not true.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Shut up, you dumb bitch. You know it's true. Where is   she now, huh? You think mommy will save you? We told her to stay out of   gambling and she brought you in instead. That drunk slut!</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">The man stopped talking, as he came inside Riu. She dropped to her knees and rested her head against the tree.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Go boys, rape some sense into this dumb bitch's head, — the leader took out a beer out of the cooler and sat on a dry log.</div>
  <div class="de1">The kidnappers were taking turns at Riu, and she was   feeling sore. Even when the lube tube was finished, they kept ravaging   and humiliating her. One of them had a small dick, and Riu was feeling   like she was having a rest when it was his turn. But after hours of rape   even he was causing her so much pain that she just collapsed on the   ground and wept.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I think she's done. It's like fucking sawdust now, I think I got blisters on my dick.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Alright, let's call it a day. Riu, can you hear me, Riu?</div>
  <div class="de2">Riu just kept weeping instead, and the leader stepped on her shoulder.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You've been a good girl, and we won't kill you. You   have to thank me for that, — he put more weight on Riu's shoulder. — I   said: you have to thank me.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu let out a distantly human wail through the dirt and snot covering her face.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That's right. I am very kind, thank you for noticing.   We are leaving now. If you are lucky, you'll find your way back. And if   you are smart, as soon as you are back, you'll pack your shit and move   the hell out. If I see you again, I will be very upset and won't give   you anymore second chances. Capiche?</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Riu kept sobbing listening to the muffled steps, until   she couldn't hear them anymore. After some more time, she gathered the   strength to stand up and put on her clothes and rummaged in the coller   to find some leftovers. She staggered towards the road and then followed   the car trails. She was exhausted and could barely walk, plus it was   getting chilly. Her mind felt numb as she kept walking. After two hours   she finally reached a highway and a gas station, where she asked for   help.</div>
  <div class="de1">The cashier boy was shocked by her appearence, and   suggested to call the police, but Riu refused. However, she accepted the   free tea and snacks he offered. As Riu recovered a bit, she called for   Nadeshiko to pick her up. Half an hour later, a cab arrived and Riu was   on her way back to the city.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">=================================</div>
  <div class="de1" id="12">12=== Et tu... Et tu... Et tu? =</div>
  <div class="de2">=================================</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh dear, what happened to you?! — Nadeshiko stormed towards Riu, as soon as she opened the door.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Some of the sore losers, I guess.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh god, that is horrible! Do you know their names?</div>
  <div class="de1">Instead of answering her, Riu glared at Nadeshiko.   Could it be her rapists told her the truth? Could Nadeshiko have   betrayed her, or rather: had never really been on her side? She felt   guilty for feeling this suspicion, but she also was agonizingly angry,   and above all else she was exhausted.</div>
  <div class="de2">— I'll talk tomorrow, — said Riu, heading off to the bathroom.</div>
  <div class="de1">She took a quick shower and went straight to bed.   During the night Nadeshiko woke up several times to check Riu's forehead   to find out she was in fever. After a good twelve hours of sleep Riu   was finally awake, and according to herself, was feeling ok.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu kept being gloomy throughout the silent breakfast,   and when it was over, she just stayed catatonic in her chair. The night   didn't take her doubts with it. If anything they only grew stronger. She   could notice the guilt in Nadeshiko's movements and indecisivness to   start the conversation abruptly stopped last night. Riu kept waiting.   She did not want to accuse Nadeshiko, since she still had a sliver of   hope that she was wrong. She was afraid to ruin their relationship, if   she herself started talking and ended up falsely accusing Nadeshiko. It   would be wiser to just hear what Nadeshiko had to say first.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">— Ahm, — Nadeshiko finally broke the silence.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu tilted her head towards her:</div>
  <div class="de1">— Yes?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Are you alright?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Do I look alright?</div>
  <div class="de2">— I don't know... , — Nadeshiko started wringing her hands at a loss as to what she should say.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I was being raped for hours in a forest and then had to walk back to civilization. Am I alright to you?</div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko pressed her lips.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I dragged my beaten body, soaked in sperm through the woods. Would you be alright?</div>
  <div class="de1">Tears strated gathering in Nadeshiko's eyes, her mouth   trembling. Riu hated herself for torturing her so much, but now she was   sure it needed to be done.</div>
  <div class="de2">— I wanted to lie down and die right there. And still I   stood up, and walked, and walked. Each step echoed with white-hot   needles thrusting between my legs? I can still feel it. Do you know why I   kept walking?</div>
  <div class="de1">Nadeshiko could not hold it any longer:</div>
  <div class="de1">— I am sorry, Riu, please, I am so sorry, — she burst out crying while covering her face.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I knew it! I knew it! — Riu sprung up pointing down at Nadeshiko. — You indeed are the worst!</div>
  <div class="de1">— Please, Riu, no. I didn't want it to be like this!</div>
  <div class="de2">— You rotten bitch, you got me into this! And you knew   it was gonna end like this! You've been using me all this time! I was so   blind!! — Riu scremed hysterically</div>
  <div class="de1">— No, Riu, you got it wrong, plese, let me...</div>
  <div class="de1">— Shut up, you whore, I know, you've done it before,   and you didn't care. You found me instead. What you gonna do now, huh?   Find another me and do it all over again?</div>
  <div class="de1">— You were different, Riu, I thought we could quit and   go somewhere else once we had enough money, please! Listen! — Nadeshiko   pleaded in vain.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">Riu approached Nadeshiko and knocked her off the chair.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Please, Riu, no! I have connections, we can make it work!</div>
  <div class="de1">— Fuck your connections! I hate you! — Riu was hurling the dishes from the table into Nadeshiko on the floor.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Please, Riu, stop! — Nadeshiko screamed in panic.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Who told you about me?! Who told you about my secret? — she picked up a butter knife from the table.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Riu, stop, you don't need to...</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu straddled Nadeshiko and brought the knife closer to her face.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Who was it?</div>
  <div class="de1">— It was Naatsuki! — Nadeshiko cried loudly</div>
  <div class="de1">— Natsuki? Why?</div>
  <div class="de2">— We used to work together, LULLABY belongs to me.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Worked together? With that shithead?! — Riu slapped Nadeshiko and put her gripped her neck</div>
  <div class="de1">— Well, how does he know? — Riu increased the pressure slightly</div>
  <div class="de1">— No idea, please, Riu, calm down! — Nadeshiko wailed through the tears</div>
  <div class="de1">— How does he know?! — Riu was strangling Nadeshiko with all her force.</div>
  <div class="de2">Nadeshiko's face turned red, only a weak wheeze could   escape her throat. Riu kept strangling Nadeshiko and repeating the   question. Finally, the wheezing stopped. Nadeshiko was only blabbering   her lips now. Riu started shaking Nadeshiko's neck up and down in blind   fury. Frustrated, she let out a loud scream, lifted Nadeshiko by the   neck and tossed her to the side.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu snapped. Every time she thought things were going   on for, it all crumbled down. Somebody out there was always planning to   drag her into the rough patch. She was desperate, she was sure that she   would never have a happy life. She had no future, all she had is past   and all she could do is take revenge on all those, who had ever wronged   her. She didn't care about the consequences. All she knew is the next   name on her list: Natsuki.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She took a paper cutting knife from the conference room   and stopped by the door before leaving this hotel room forever. She   glanced at Nadeshiko lying on the carpet one last time. "I hope she's   dead," — thought Riu. Riu went out and put a "Do not disturb" tag on the   doorknob.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">She had to hurry. If Natsuki still kept his schedule,   he would start his shift in one hour. Hopefully, she could ambush him on   the way to LULLABY. Sooner or later Nadeshiko will be discovered. Riu   will be featured in a bolo and would be unable to walk the streets. It   was her one and only chance to get Natsuki. That beast with a sly smile,   who started it all. He was the one to trigger her downfall, and he   didn't stop at that. That horrible person's retribution was coming soon.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu took the metro to get to LULLABY, keeping the knife   betweene the folds of her dress. She would not hesitate to use it. Her   mind was looping the images of the impending murder over and over again.   She arrived to her destination and checked the bus stop clock: just in   time. Any minute now Natsuki would appear on this street. Ten minutes   later she saw him from afar and started walking towards him. When their   eyes met, Riu smiled as innocently as ever. Clueless Natsuki smiled back   and waved at her. As they met, Riu started spouting some nonsense about   thinking lately about Natsuki and how much the memories of their last   encounter turned her on. The dumb horny bastard took the bait and   followed Riu to an alleyway, where she took out the knife and pointed at   Natsuki's stomach.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">— Oooooh, Riu, — he eclaimed in shock raising both his hands. — Should've known it's too good to be true. Calm down now.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Do you know Nadeshiko?</div>
  <div class="de1">— I swear to god, I have no idea what you're talking about.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Don't you lie to me! — she said through closed teeth, giving Natsuki mad eyes, and poked him with the tip of the blade.</div>
  <div class="de1">Natsuki backed up, but hit a wall.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Alright, alright. I'll tell you whatever you want to know, just don't hurt me.</div>
  <div class="de1">— We'll see... Did you tell Nadeshiko about me?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Nooo!</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu tilted her head. The tip was now on the verge of piercing Natsuki's skin.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Aagh, ok. Yes, yes. She said she needed a good   mahjong player asap, so I told her you were good, that's it! What's the   big deal?!</div>
  <div class="de2">— How did you know about my students and me? — Riu twisted the knife slightly.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oooh, Riu, you will not like it.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Spit it out!</div>
  <div class="de1">— It was Chiori, she came here one day and told me how   you had stolen her boyfriend or such. I thought she was just fishing for   attention, or that you had a boyfriend and she was jealous. But she   told me the whole thing, how you seduced a little boy and how mad she   was at you, and she even showed me the photos that brat must've sneaked   on you. She told me she wished you disappeared. It was nuts, I didn't   believe it one bit, except the part where she hated your guts. That was   sincere, 100% sincere hatred. I told it to Nadeshiko just because I   thought it was funny. Was that real?</div>
  <div class="de1">— None of your business, scumbag.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu stabbed Natsuki multiple times in the abdomen, and   as he was sliding down the wall she landed two more stabs in his crotch.   Natsuki gurgled blood and curled on the ground. Riu then took of the   blood stained glove off her right hand and wiped the blade with it. She   threw away the glove and inspected herself. Her dress and apron were   soaked in blood. She discarded the apron and looked at herself again,   she squintd. Dark blood was hard to notice on the black fabric. She had   nothing to worry.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu now had one more stop on her list. Hopefully Chiori was home.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu took off her shoes and sprinted barefoot towards Chiori's place. At the entrance she called Chiori's flat.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Yees? — Chiori responded on the other side of the intercom.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, how lucky! Miss Mikami, this is Kujou Riu. I was   just passing by and thought it would be great if we could have some tea,   like we used to. Share the news...</div>
  <div class="de1">— Ahhhm... Not really — the crackly speaker responded.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, please, miss Mikami, I have some very important news to share with you.</div>
  <div class="de1">Chiori kept silent for a few seconds.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Miss Mikami?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Whatever... — Said Mikami and the magnetic lock beeped indicating Riu could enter.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">At the floor Riu waite for two minutes, before Chiori opened the door.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Come in, maid, what was it? — she said in a disinterested voice.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">As they stood in the corridor, Mikami repeated, rubbing her eye. Was she having a nap?</div>
  <div class="de1">— What was it, Riu?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Do you hat me, miss Mikami?</div>
  <div class="de1">The sudden question threw Chiori off. Her sleep was gone, she looked closer at Riu and her eys widened.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Why are you holding a knife?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Say, why do you hate me? Was I not kind enough to you? — Riu  questioned terfully.</div>
  <div class="de1">Chiori started slowly backing into the flat. Riu followed.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh god, is that blood?! — Chiori noticed the huge stains, which by now had turned into thick brown crust.</div>
  <div class="de1">Chiori leaped away from Riu. Riu chased her and just   moments later knocked her down. Chiori tried to crawl away, but Riu   forcefully pulled her leg and sat on tiny Chiori's chest. She was   flailing her hands at Riu to no avail</div>
  <div class="de2">— Let me go, you psycho! — She screamed. — Police! Police!</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu swayed the knife and grazed Chiori's arm. Red blood oozed from the wound.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Aaah!!! Stop it you, mad maid!</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu restarted her manic interrogation.</div>
  <div class="de1">— What was it? Did you not like my scrambled eggs? —   She swayed again. — Were the bookshelves too dusty for you? — And again.   — Or did you hate my choice of fabric softener?</div>
  <div class="de2">Riu was frantically shaking the knife in the air   occasionally wounding Chiori's arms. Finally, Chiori gave up and rested   her bloody arms on the floor.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You are pervert! The worst kind of person! That's why   I hate you! You took him from me! Did you think I am too young to   notice, what you were doing?! You are trash, you are worse than trash.   You are a psychotic pedo! You seduced him! He was mine and you took him   away! That's why I hate you!</div>
  <div class="de1">Chiori screemed in her high-pitched voice. She had no   fear, she kept pouring all the most horrible insults she could think of.   Spit was flying out of her mouth.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu was silently taking it all in, dumbfounded at this   brat's audacity. Finally, she grew tired, swang her arm and pierced   right through Chiori's throat.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That will shut you up. — She said calmly, standing up.</div>
  <div class="de2">Blood gushed into Chiori's lungs and she started   coughing red foam. In her final moments she was trying to take out the   knife hilt deep inside her neck. Finally she managed and instantly lost   consciousness, red blood still pulsating out of the open wound. Riu   stood for a few minutes looking at Chiori's body. She wiped her forehead   with the back of her palm, smearing blood across her face. Chori's   blood was everywhere. Riu was covered in it. She looked at herself in   the big mirror in Chiori's room and thought that the new colors   perfectly matched her red hair and red eyes.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Finally, Riu was at peace with herself. She got to the   core of it. She solved everything that bothered her, and she was sure   that all these horrible people, who had ruined her life got what they   deserved. They would never hurt her again.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">In a trance-like state, Riu went out of the building,   her skin and clothes covered in blood. It was getting dark. Riu did not   know where to go, so she went to a train station. As she entered the   brightly lit area near the station, people all around her dashed away.   It was not so much blood as the overall aura of death she emanated. Even   if she had a fresh dress on, people would still feel uneasy around her.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu boarded a car and sat down on an empty seat. Other   passengers nearby hurried to leave the car, before the doors closed and   inform the police.</div>
  <div class="de1">But Riu did not care. She did not care at all. She was   serene. It was much more tranquil in an empty car. So much so, that she   spread across the empty seats. The train took off, and the rhythmic   thumping of the wheels lulled her into sleep.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">================================</div>
  <div class="de1" id="13">13=== Out of train experience  =</div>
  <div class="de1">================================</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu woke up as the train came to a halt. She was still   alone in the car and as she shook of the sleep, and tried to remember,   where she was going. The speakers announced that it was the terminus.   The beeping sound warned Riu the doors would soon close, so she hurried   out to the platform. As the train was gaining speed, she looked around.   It was a warm summer night in a rural area. Bugs were hitting the sodium   lamps high above and the breeze was caressing the tall grass   surrounding the station. The platform itself looked primitive and   unkempt. Weeds resided in the cracks on the grey concrete. A brute,   rough shed with a lamp on its lintel looked miserable. Just in case, Riu   looked around her once again to check if there was anything more   resembling an exit. No.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">She went towards the shed hoping to find somebody to   help her, or at least a timetable. The dimly lit inside of the shed   offered nothing but a shabby desk with a notebook and a pen. Riu came   closer to see if that could be anything important. She flipped through   the empty checkered pages. The notebook was empty, apart from a   hand-written title on its title page: "Jantama station reports journal"   and the headers at the top of each page. ['#','Date', 'Time', 'Name',   'Description']</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Jantama station... Riu never heard of it. She wondered   how far away from home she was. She peeked outside of the shed and saw   nothing but an empty dirt road. Wow, that was quite unfortunate. All   alone, at night, stranded at an unknown station. At least no creepy   types were around, thanks for that.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Without nothing better to do, Riu flipped through the   notebook again. Huh, there was actually something else written in it.   She must have skipped the first page while flipping it the first time. </div>

  <div class="de2">Most unnerving: the second entry was written in her own   handwriting as well. This was eerie. Her heart racing, Riu checked both   sides of the shed. Still not a soul around. How could that be? Was she   going crazy? Thinking of it, she could not remember how she got on the   train or what her destination was. She reached for the phone in her   apron, but there was no apron. Heh?</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu took a closer look at her hands. She only had one   glove on her left arm and her right arm was dirty. It was hard to tell   under the dim lighting, what exactly it was. She rubbed her fingers   together and the dirt peeled off in long thin pieces. She tried smelling   her hands. They smelled like sweat, nothing special. Riu took of her   glove to see that it was crusted. She could not tell what it was with   certainty, but the texture... The texture reminded her of old blood   stains. Was she covered in blood? Anxiously, she slapped her dress and   discovered all her dress was covered in the same crust. Frightened, Riu   took the glove and gnawed onto it. The salive soked the fabric and she   tasted what the stains were made of.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Oh god, she was covered in blood! Was it hers? She   hugged herself trying to find a wound. No. It was somebody else's. Riu   grabbed the notebook and checked the entries again. As she had feared,   there were more.</div>

  <div class="de2">— Oh, nonononono. This can't be.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu pulled and pushed on the door leading outside the platform, but it wouldn't budge! Despair filled her heart.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu frantically took the pen and scribbled #3. However, the ink soaked through the page and disappeared.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— This can't be. What was that other entry? Where is it? Where is it? — she screamed at the notebook.</div>
  <div class="de2">Riu tried the door once again. It still wouldn't budge!</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Oh, nonononono!!! What should I do? — Riu panicked. — That other entry... It started with "now"!</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu started writing a new entry. She could hear metal   noises coming from the side of the platform. She was terrified and too   scared to check what was approaching her from that side.</div>

  <div class="de2">'''</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu rushed out of the shed and ran up the road. She   lifted her skirt and ran as fast as she could. Although, after the   initial sprint she was out of breath and was about to vomit, she kept   running even faster since she felt more than life depended on it. She   could not tell whether anybody was chasing her, since all she could hear   is her own heartbeat and heavy puffing.</div>
  <div class="de1">Half way up she saw twinkling torch light ahead and as   she got closer, she could see the silhouette of the shrine gate!   Finally, she made it, just a bit more and she is saved!</div>
  <div class="de1">In the darkness Riu stepped on a wild rock, fell and   sprained her knee. Oh no! She could not run anymore. As she slowly and   painfully limped up the hill, Riu dared to look back. She saw shadows   darker than the night itself devouring the moonlit pine forest. She let   out a shriek and started dragging her injured leg with both her hands,   instinctively hoping that would relieve her pain and let her move   faster.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Just a bit more, the gate was so close! She had to   reach it! She had to reach it or else! She looked back again. The   darkness was even closer, she was moving too slow! Her eyes filled with   tears of absolute horror. Riu let off her hands and started jumping on   one leg towards the gate that was so close. Yes! She touched the gate   post!</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">However, she could not do the final step. Her dress was   stuck in something? Was it stuck in a bush or something? Riu turned her   head and saw hands with greenish rotting pieces of flesh falling off   tugging at her dress. She was too late! Too late! Riu held onto the post   crying loudly.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de2">— Pleeese! Heeelp! Somebody! Help meeee! I need   heeeeelp! — hot tears of sespair running down her cheeks. The black   cloud produced a long thin tongue that started licking the tears off her   face.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Suddenly, a young girl in traditional clothes rushed down the stairs of the shrine towards the gate.</div>
  <div class="de1">— She reached ~nya! Back off! Back off! She's mine! —   the girl with short hair and glimmering eyes started beating the hands   holding Riu with a ceremonial baton, remaining on the shrine's side of   the gate.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Hold my hand ~nya! — the mysterious maiden offered Riu her slender hand.</div>
  <div class="de2">— I can't let go!  — weeped Riu.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Just trust me!</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu took one arm off the post and instantly felt the   cloud's pull increased twofold. She was jerked towards the darknes,   however the mysterious girl grabbed her hand just in time. As she did   so, the cloud behind Riu dissipated. Riu dropped to the ground and   landed on the right side of the gate.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Welcome to the Mahjong Soul Shrine ~nya! — the girl smiled widely.</div>
  <div class="de2">At this moment Riu noticed her saviour had fangs, ears and a fluffy tail.</div>
  <div class="de1">— You are a cat! — exclaimed Riu still in shock after the chase for life.</div>
  <div class="de1">— How rude ~nya! My name is Ichihime ~nya, — pouted the   girl. — You barely made it, you have to be more kind to me, you know?   Do you have any snacks?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Nno...</div>
  <div class="de1">— Eugh, how so! Nobody brings Ichihime any snacks ~nya, — Ichihime's ears lowered.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu stood up and gave out a sigh of surprise as her   knee no longer hurt. She gave out even more surprised sighs, as she   noticed her dress was as good as new with no stains or tears. Even her   apron was back.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— What is this?!</div>
  <div class="de1">— This is what two delicious cookies in debt looks like ~nya! You owe me. Now, follow me.</div>
  <div class="de2"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Riu obediently followed Ichihime upstairs taking in the   surroundings. It was still night, but the whole shrine perimeter had   not a single dark spot. Thick rope with paper strips was hanging between   the trees demarkating the border of the shrine grounds.</div>
  <div class="de1">As Riu reached the place at the top of the hill, a girl   with peach hair and a traditional shrine maiden suit emerged from one   of the buildings on its side.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Another one? At night? — The girl had a concerned look on her face. — Would you like some herb tea?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Y-yes, please, — Riu nodded to the girl.</div>
  <div class="de2">— My name is Mai, Aihara Mai, by the way. What is yours?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Kujou Riu.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Alright, Kujou Riu! Pleased to meet you. I'll be right away.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">Ichihime showed Rius towards a bench and Riu sit down.   It faced the mountain side, but since it was night, hardly anything   below the shrine grounds could be seen. "At day the should be   magnificent, though" — Riu though to herself.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Noooww ~nya, — started Ichihime. — You must have been a very naughty girl. Not everybody comes here at night.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Am I... dead? — Riu asked in a hushed voice</div>
  <div class="de1">— Not necessarily ~nya. People end up here for a   variety of reasons. Some are dead, some are lost, others lose their   soul. Only Kaavi can tell which one it is.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Kaavi?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Ah yes, our prophet girl ~nya. She is a bunny, by the   way. I am saying that you don't say anything stupid, when you first   meet her ~nya. — said Ichihime with her face puckered.</div>
  <div class="de2">— I'm sorry.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Don't be ~nya. I'm just trying to brighten up the mood ~nya, — she swang her legs. — You almost ended up in hell, after all.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu shivered. Keeping silent for a moment, Ichihime continued.</div>
  <div class="de1">— This is Mahnong Soul shrine ~nya. Some lost souls end   up here ~nya. We train them, and test them with mahjong. When they are   ready, we release them back to the world ~nya.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Mahjong? The tile game? Is that right?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Oh yes, the game. You know how to play it ~nya?</div>
  <div class="de1">— I don't... really know. All I know is my name and that when I arrived, all my clothes were soaked in blood.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Oof, that sounds serious ~nya...</div>
  <div class="de1">— Why do you keep saying ~nya?</div>
  <div class="de1">— I'm a cat, don't you know already? That's what cats   do. That's three cookies now. One more cat-related question and it will   be five cookies. Believe me, you don't want to know how hard it is to   get cookies in here. Nya.</div>
  <div class="de2">— So... why mahjong?</div>
  <div class="de1">— It shows how much flow you have in your soul restored   ~nya. Not only that, balanced souls, that are ready to go, play   balanced mahjong ~nya. Sometimes it is enough to let a balanced soul go,   even if it is low in flow ~nya. My flow is perfect though, so I just   play by feel and it always ends up well for me ~nya.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Were you a lost soul as well?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Hhahahahahha, that was dangerously close to a   cookie-question ~nya. No. I'm a goddess ~nya. A benevolent goddess that   helps the poor girls and boys such as you. I cannot leave ~nya.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Is Aihara a goddess too? </div>
  <div class="de2">— Pffft, no.  Far from it ~nya. She is a good girl, though. She chose to stay here and help me ~nya. Just like Kaavi.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">At this point Mai and Kaavi approached a goddess and a   lost soul sitting on the bench. Mai was carrying a tray with a small   teapot and a set of bowls. Kaavi carried a crystal ball and had a stern   look on her face.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Are you... Kaavi? — Riu looked at Kaavi's bunny ears piercing through her hood and a bunny tail.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Huh? How do you know? Are you a prophet as well? —   Kaavi widened her eyes and blushed a little, although her face marks hid   the blush.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Perhaps...</div>
  <div class="de1">— Eehh? — Kaavi widened her eyes even more</div>
  <div class="de1">— She doesn't know who she is ~nya. That's what she   meant ~nya. Now look into your crystal ball and tell me what I should do   with her ~nya, — Ichihime said a little irritated.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Yes, Ichihime. — Kaavi started chanting into the crystal ball.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That might take a while, hehe. Have some tea, Riu, — Mai handed her a bowl.</div>
  <div class="de2">— I just hope we're done before the sun rises ~nya, — murmured Ichihime and loudly sipped from her bowl.</div>
  <div class="de1">Suddenly, Kaavi stopped chanting and looked at Riu with concern.</div>
  <div class="de1">— That is very serious, Riu. You are still alive.</div>
  <div class="de1">— What-what? Let me see ~nya, — Ichihime took the ball out of Kaavi's hands. — Oooh. Oooooh. Ohohoho ~nya.</div>
  <div class="de1">— What is there, let me see! — Riu peeked behind Ichihime's shoulder.</div>
  <div class="de2">— You can't see it ~nya.</div>
  <div class="de1">— It is my life, show it to me!</div>
  <div class="de1">— You don't understand ~nya. You wouldn't see even if   you wanted to, — Ichihime brought the ball close to Riu's face. — See   ~nya?</div>
  <div class="de1">All Riu could see is just a bunch of sparks and clouds inside the glass.</div>
  <div class="de1">— And I can see ~nya. I see all your life here ~nya. Even what is happening now.</div>
  <div class="de2">— What is it?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Hmmm ~nya. You are on trial.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Did i kill anyone?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Hmm, yes. You did ~nya. Seems like your body and mind   do not need a soul anymore. You were rejected by them ~nya. — Ichihime   shook her head.</div>
  <div class="de1">— How so? Was I such a bad person?</div>
  <div class="de2">— Ahm... — Ichihime rolled her eyes and gave back the   ball back to Kaavi. — Thank you, Kaavi, you can go back to sleep. You   too Mai.</div>
  <div class="de1">Two shrine maidens went back to the building.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Well... We've had worse ~nya. I've had worse, —   Ichihime looked in the direction of the girls going away. — We'll think   of something for you.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">A little girl with long blonde hair came up to   Ichihime, holding a teddy bear in her arms. The girl tugged at   Ichihime's wide sleeve.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Ichihime, is this a new girl?</div>
  <div class="de1">Ichihime wrinkled her forehead and pressed her lips, then turned to the girl.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Ah, yes, Chiori. We have a new friend here ~nya. Were we too loud?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Did she arrive at night as well?</div>
  <div class="de1">— Yes, Chiori. She has just arrived ~nya. Go back to sleep, I'll introduce her tomorrow to everybody.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Should I wait til morning? — asked Chiori rubbing her eyes.</div>
  <div class="de1">— My name is Kujou Riu. Pleased to meet you. Let's be   friends, — said Riu with a smile, waved a little and then extended her   hand for a handshake.</div>
  <div class="de1">— I'm older than you think I am, you know? — Said   Chiori a bit disappoined by Riu's condescending gestures. — My name is   Mikami Chiori. Pleased to meet you.</div>
  <div class="de1">Riu felt awkward for a moment, until Chiori finally shook her hand.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Kujou Riu... Kujou Riu... Let's be friends. Tomorroooow, — said Chiori while yawning and walked back to her dormitory.</div>
  <div class="de2">— Sleep tight ~nya.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Sleep tight, Chiori.</div>
  <div class="de1"> </div>
  <div class="de1">— Are there many people in here? — asked Riu staring in Chiori's back.</div>
  <div class="de1">— Quite a few ~nya. Quite a few ~nya... You must be   tired ~nya. Now, let me show your bed, we'll start training you tomorrow   ~nya.</div>
— I can't wait, — replied Riu finishing her tea to follow Ichihime in the dormitory.</div>
