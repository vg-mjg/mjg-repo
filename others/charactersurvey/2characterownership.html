    <h1>Characters and Outfits</h1>
    <h2>All Characters Owned</h2>

    <p>
      Here are the results for all characters owned.
    </p>

    <img class="image-middle" src="charts/2allchars/Total characters owned all responders Form Order.png" alt="All chracters owned chart" width="80%">

    <p>
      The order in the chart above is in the same order as the survey form, where it's all female characters then male characters, in their release order. <br>
      This gives a nice visualisation of how many people actually roll on Bamboo, with the sharp dropoff from Mila (newest girl with 20) to Natsuki (oldest guy with only 6 people owning him).
    </p>
    <p>
      The chart also shows the popularity of collabs. Older collabs like the Kakegurui and Saki collabs show low numbers for character ownership, while recent ones like the Fate Heavens Feel collab have much higher ownership than characters released around it (a lot less people have rolled Mario and Luigi despite being released around the same time for example).<br> 
      A notable character in this chart is Yuzu (35), who stands out compared to regular characters released before and after her. <br>
      It's no surprise that nobody on /mjg/ cares about Fei Ming, only 1 anon who answered the survey has ever rolled him.
    </p>

    <p>Below are some other charts with character ownership linked with rank:</p>

    <h2>Paid Outfits / Skins</h2>
    <p>
      The survey featured a few questions on paid outfits, asking about whether animated / live2D outfits are preferred to regular outfits, and whether people buy new outfits for their main when they get released. <br>
      Here's the chart showing whether people prefer animated or non-animated skins.
    </p>

    <img class="image-middle" src="charts/2allchars/Live2d prefer animated over regular pie.png" alt="prefer live2d over regular skins pie chart" width="80%">

    <p>
      As an anon pointed out this question didn't have an "I don't care" option, which is quite important considering this question was required and a sizeable number of people don't care about outfits at all in Majsoul. Sorry for not including that option, by the time I noticed the survey had already been answered by a number of people. <br>
      Knowing this, 72% of people voted No for this question. This isn't too surprising considering that the outfit is more expensive if it's animated. Even so, a lot of people do like the animated skins regardless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are people's attitudes towards a new outfit for their main and whether people buy them or not.
    </p>

      Other responses:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>I bought an outfit once, never again.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>I would if yostar actually made them on a regular basis</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>if I have money to spare</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Just be selected from the giveaway.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>No, outfits are expensive when your currency is monopoly money</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>No, these pngs are too expensive</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>none i like yet but i will</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Only if it's Steve to help the steveconomy</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>paying for pngs lmao</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>No, my main is a limited time character so it's unlikely they will get another outfit at all</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      And here are the amount of outfits people own. To demonstrate the distribution I have included every bar from 0 to 72(!) outfits making the bar graph quite wide. I've also done the same with the amount of bonded characters in the next section. <br>
      There's definitely a way to better demonstrate this, but this gets the idea across. Sorry phonefags
    </p>

    <a href="charts/2allchars/paid outfits.png"><img class="image-middle" src="charts/2allchars/paid outfits.png" alt="Distribution of the amount of paid outfits owned" width="90%"></a>

    <p>
      It comes to no surprise that the majority of people own only 0-5 outfits, probably for the characters they main. There is a trail of whales on the end though, 72 outfits is crazy
    </p>

    <h2>Bonded characters</h2>

    <p>
      Similarly to above, below is a chart of the amount of characters people have bonded.
    </p>

    <a href="charts/2allchars/bonded chars.png"><img class="image-middle" src="charts/2allchars/bonded chars.png" alt="Distribution of amount of bonded chars" width="90%"></a>

    <p>
      It's a very similar distribution to the paid outfits, except people have bonded more characters on average than owning outfits. <br>
      However on the whale end of the spectrum, less people have over 20 bonded characters compared to the amount of people with over 20 outfits.
    </p>

    <h2>VIP Level</h2>

    <p>
      In the survey there was a question asking people to fill in their VIP level, which directly correlates with how much people have whaled in the game. You get 6 VIP points for every $1 you spend. <br>
      Using this we can produce the following table:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th><b>VIP Level</b></th>
        <th><b>USD Equivalent (Approx)</b></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>No Title (0-5 VIP)</td>
        <td>$0 - $1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Contractor 1 (6 - 29 VIP)</td>
        <td>$1 - $5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Contractor 2 (30 - 59 VIP)</td>
        <td>$5 - $10</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Contractor 3 (60 - 99 VIP)</td>
        <td>$10 - $16</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Enlightener 1 (100 - 249 VIP)</td>
        <td>$16 - $41</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Enlightener 2 (250 - 499 VIP)</td>
        <td>$41 - $83</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Enlightener 3 (500 - 999 VIP)</td>
        <td>$83 - $166</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Creator 1 (1000 - 1999 VIP)</td>
        <td>$166 - $333</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Creator 2 (2000 - 2999 VIP)</td>
        <td>$333 - $500</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Creator 3 (3000 - 3999 VIP)</td>
        <td>$500 - $666</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Soul Excelsior (4000 - 4999 VIP)</td>
        <td>$666 - $833</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Cat Food Supplier (5000 - 7999 VIP)</td>
        <td>$833 - $1333</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Protector of Cat Kingdom (8000 - 11999 VIP)</td>
        <td>$1333 - $2000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>General of Cat Kingdom (12000 - 17999 VIP)</td>
        <td>$2000 - $3000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Zenith of Cat Kingdom (18000+ VIP)</td>
        <td>$3000+ (yes, seriously)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>    

    <p>
      This was an optional question but only 2 anons didn't fill it out, giving us 123 entries worth of data here. Here are a horizontal bar chart and a cumulative frequency graph showing the distribution of whales.
    </p>

    <img class="image-middle" src="charts/2allchars/VIP level cumulative.png" alt="VIP level cum graph" width="80%">

    <p>
      Using the data we can see that a quarter of the anons who answered the survey are between 0 and 30 VIP points (0 - $5), showing around a quarter of /mjg/ are F2P. Around 52% of anons are between 0 and 499 VIP points (Soul Enlightener 2), which means around 48% of anons are higher, spending at least $83 or more on the game.<br>
      6 anons who answered the survey are gigawhales who have spent over $3000 on the game so far over the 7 years the game has been out.
