    <h1>General Questions</h1>
    <p>
      This section is the bulk of optional bonus questions that was asked at the end of the survey.
    </p>

    <h2>Regularly played modes of Online Mahjong</h2>
    <p>
      This question could've been worded better, but this was basically asking what kinds of Mahjong people regularly play when on a client online, whether it's sanma, ranked, friendlies, battle of asura etc.
    </p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>autokoko chads...</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>lmao sugma</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ranked (forma tenhou)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Seeing the Other responses I should've maybe added Autotable as an option, or asked a question about other online mahjong clients people play. Oh well.
    </p>
    
    <h2>When did anons find /mjg/?</h2>
    <img class="image-middle" src="charts/4generalqs/mjg years vertical bar.png" alt="mjg years bar chart" width="80%">

    <p>
      A surprisingly even distribution across the years, /mjg/ has grown steadily it seems. According to the results, around 10% of players in the general found /mjg/ in 2019 when Majsoul first came to EN.<br>
      It makes me wonder how the results would change if this question was asked again during league time.
    </p>

    <h2>Collab reruns</h2>
    <p>
      The next question asked "If you could pick one collab to rerun, which collab would you pick?". The question featured every collab in the past to see what most people are interested in.
    </p>

    <img class="image-middle" src="https://files.riichi.moe/mjg/mjg%20projects/character%20survey%202026/charts/22%20Collab%20reruns/collab%20rerun%20bar.png" alt="collab rerun bar chart" width="80%">

    <p>
      Saki is by far the most requested rerun at 36 responses, while Akagi is second at 24. Saki already had a rerun in the past adding four more characters, so it's possible. <br>
      Maybe people just want to roll Koromo.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would be nice for a Hat rerun or for imouto to get released (fucking never ;_;)
    </p>

    <h2>How people found out about Riichi Mahjong</h2>

    <img class="image-middle" src="charts/4generalqs/how did you get into riichi.png" alt="how did anons find out about riichi mahjong horizontal bar chart" width="80%">

    <p>
      The chart shows that most people found out about Mahjong through anime, whether it's Akagi, Saki or something else. <br>
      The other answers are quite varied. I'm quite surprised very few learned Riichi through their family, as in my head I thought this common in Asian families. Maybe people learned a different kind of Mahjong this way? <br>
      Quite cool that a fifth of the people who answered found out Mahjong through 4chan, whether it's through /mjg/ or some thread on /a/, /v/ or /jp/.
    </p>

      Some Other responses fit under the pre-existing categories so not all of them are shown here.

    <h2>IRL Mahjong</h2>

    <p>
      Two questions on IRL Mahjong, whether people regularly go to a Mahjong club and whether people have ever joined an IRL mahjong tournament. Here are the charts.
