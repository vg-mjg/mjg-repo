    </p>

    <p>
      These graphs are pretty big due to the amount of bars I've had to use - there's now 116 (118 after CNY) characters which is pretty insane. The characters who weren't picked aren't included here.
      <br>
      Unsurprisingly Ichihime is the most popular main with Steve taking second.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following 50 characters didn't get picked as anyones main:

    <h2>Second main</h2>
    <p>
      Next is the chart for people's second mains, or second favourite character to use. <br>
      One thing to note is that some anons answered the same character for their main, second and third main.
    </p>

    <img class="image-middle" src="charts/1top3mains/Second mains.png" alt="Majsoul Second Mains chart" width="80%">

    <h3>Third main</h3>
    <p>
      And here are the third mains. As majsoul only has two default characters there was also the choice for "I don't have 3 characters" for this question.
    </p>

    <img class="image-middle" src="charts/1top3mains/Third mains.png" alt="Majsoul Third Mains chart" width="80%">

    <h2>Characters picked in top 3 mains</h2>
    <p>
      This next chart shows the total count of characters that are mentioned in peoples top 3 mains. Characters are only counted once - some anons put a single character as all three of their top 3 mains (yuzu and cats). <br>
      For the data in this chart I have only counted them once. This should give us a general idea of what characters are popular in /mjg/ and who people like to play.<br>
      I left in the "I don't have 3 characters" option for this graph too.


    </p>

    <img class="image-middle" src="charts/1top3mains/Top 3 mains.png" alt="Majsoul Third Mains chart" width="80%">


    <p>
      This is a decent distribution of characters, with only 21 out of the 116 character cast not being in anyones top 3 characters as their mains. <br>
      <i>All</i> of the unpicked characters are limited or males, meaning every permanent female character was picked by at least someone in their top 3 mains.<br>
