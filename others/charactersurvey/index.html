    <h1>The /mjg/ Character Survey 2026 Intro</h1>

    <p>
      In January I set up a questionnaire for /mjg/ anons to fill out detailing their top 3 characters and all the characters they own, with some bonus questions at the end just for fun.<br>
      I received 125 responses and here are the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The planned release date of this was supposed to be at the beginning of February, but due to my ambition to trying to learn R / tidyverse to make the charts, it has taken a bit longer than expected. Sorry about that. <br>
      The surveys main aim was to find out the characters people use, however I also added some extra questions to the end. All of the results are compiled into charts and graphs over the next few web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The majority of the extra questions were optional and (to my surprise) most anons answered every question, so we have a surprising amount of data. <br>
      However, they weren't all optional and, as pointed out in the thread, some anons answering the survey didn't want to answer every question. In hindsight I should've made <i>all</i> of the bonus questions optional. <br>
      As a result it's best to take the data shown in this survey with a pinch of salt. I will mention any outliers or cases where there were clear shitposts skewing the results.

    <p>
      There has been at least two character surveys in the past, one in Jan 2020 (<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMPfJAKmfuCkiOhXpLgPaPPeoJjRjJar_59tr4rKqC-5-_1g/viewanalytics">survey</a>, <a href="https://files.riichi.moe/mjg/mjg%20projects/mjg%20character%20survey.jpg">infographic</a>) and one in 2023 found <a href="https://files.riichi.moe/mjg/mjg%20projects/character%20survey%202023/">here</a>. <br>
      The data is on the file repo <a href="https://files.riichi.moe/mjg/mjg%20projects/character%20survey%202026/">here</a>, however the answer order between each question is scrambled to keep anonymity.
