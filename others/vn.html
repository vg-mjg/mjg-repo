      <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Shhh. Pretend this doesn't exists. This doesn't have anything   to do with mahjong anyways. It's just here because I'm too lazy to make a   new site and I wanna share some VNs to my friends/bookmark these shits.   Pastebin sucks.</p>
    <p>Don't play Visual Novels. It's a   black hole to your time, time you could spend improving your mahjong   skills. Damn your time would be more well spent re-reading Riichi Book 1   or Riichi Mahjong Strategy. Go press that back button.</p>
    <p>Shoo. Shoo.</p>
    <p>Nobody cares about /vn/.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.ryuugames.com/"><strong>ryuugames</strong></a></p>
    <p>More recent releases of English and Japanese vns can be found   here. Although older titles are hard to find, if something new comes   up... wait shouldn't you just torrent that shit? Eh.</p>
    <p><a href="http://nahucirujano.blogspot.com/"><strong>Nahu and Friends</strong></a></p>
    <p>My friend. In my early days of VN I used this site, as well as   google translate, since it was my only source of vns. No worries,   they're all english vns. I use this for older releases sometimes.</p>
    <p><a href="https://erogedownload.com/"><strong>Eroge Downloads</strong></a></p>
    <p>Mentioned for completeness' sake. Shit ass download speeds,   only go here if you're truly desperate. If you're going to use this   cancer, use <a href="http://jdownloader.org/download/offline">jdownloader</a> as well, the no ads version.</p>

    <h1>Rec Charts</h1>
    <p>Here are some rec charts from /vn/    </p>
    <p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/bb0eo5.jpg"><strong>/vg/ Recommendations Chart 2015</strong></a></p>
    <p>Start here. Pretty solid recs despite being 5 years old. For newer   updates, it's better to refer on the other charts below. There's a   meme-filled 2017 version of the chart somewhere. But if you aren't sure   where to start, this is as good a place to do so anyways.</p>
    <p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/UlTGuHu.jpg"><strong>Plotge Chart v1.3</strong></a></p>
    <p>A list of plotge (plot-focused VNs). It isn't updated yet since Raging Loop and Bokuten AND BALDR SKY has already been released. </p>

    <h1>Learning Japanese</h1>
    <p>It's time to stop being a filthy EOP, since Monobeno isn't going to be translated in your lifetime.</p>
    <p>And if you're from /mjg/, please translate the next Strip Mahjong movie.    </p>
    <p><a href="https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/"><strong>itazuraneko</strong></a></p>
    <p>The site this repo is based on. Is a complete resource of   everything you might need to learning this dying language. It's resource   section is one of the best comprehensive collection of Japanese   material around, and is something mjg-repo's resource section will never   be.</p>
    <p><a href="https://djtguide.neocities.org/guide.html"><strong>/djt/ guide</strong></a></p>
    <p>I don't know if /djt/ still uses this site, but it's still a good starting place to learn Japanese.</p>
    <p><a href="https://compellingcontent.neocities.org/"><strong>Compelling Content</strong></a></p>
    <p>A short guide in learning Japanese. An alternative to the /djt/ guide.</p>
    <p><a href="https://hochanh.github.io/rtk/index.html"><strong>rtk-search</strong></a></p>
    <p>Having a hard time remembering the kanji? Try this to see you can find an easier way than "write that kanji 30 times".</p>
    <p><a href="https://ichi.moe/"><strong>ichi.moe</strong></a></p>
    <p>My savior. Holy shit Hanahira stumped me until I found this site.   It's basically a Japanese "translator", but how it does it is that it   breaks down the sentence into its own individual parts and translates   those. An indispensable tool for the Japanese learner. I love you,   please don't disappear forever. Offline mode never.</p>
    <p><a href="https://core6000.neocities.org/dojg/"><strong>Dictionary of Japanese Grammar</strong></a></p>
    <p>A dictionary of Japanese grammar. What more do you need? </p>

    <p>Read vn with the assistance of stuff like texthookers to ease your raw vn reading experience. It's like the ichi.moe of unhealthy steroids.</p>
