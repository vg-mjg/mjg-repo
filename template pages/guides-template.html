                        <p>For starters, you'll need a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" title="">Github account</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> installed in your computer. With this, you should be able to create a fork of the repo for you to modify.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/w7gmfg.png" class="w-100" alt=""></p>
                        <p>With your own copy of the repo, it's time for you to clone it to your computer.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/873lsh.png" class="w-100" alt=""></p>
                        <p>And now you need to just download the repo to your computer:</p>
                        <code>git clone https://github.com/Furitenman/mjg-repo.git</code>
                        <p class="pt-3">And that's it! You can start working on the repo.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/git-cheat-sheet" target="_blank" title="">Learn more about git.</a></p>
                        <p>Then, you should be familiar with Bootstrap. It's a library that does pretty much all the hard work in terms of css and html. You just need to invoke classes accordingly to your needs.</p>

                        <h1 id="modify">What to modify</h1>
                        <p>The easiest thing to do with this template is just modify this structure and add content. Check all the <code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tags for their id, which you may want to modify to something more accurate to what you want to section. Then modify the navbar's links according to this ids, which will help others to quickly surf through the pages.</p>
                        <h1 id="repo">Add to the repo</h1>
                        <p>You got your guide ready? Now it's time to push to the repo.</p>
                        <p><code>git add mynewguide.html<br>
                                 git commit -m 'Check out this new guide'<br>
                                 git push repository master</code></p>
                      </div>
                      <h1 id="extra">Extra autism</h1>
                      <p>Okay, let me wear the mask of an autist for a while then because I just feel like writing an essay. Names can in general be split into two main categories: major one being names that are given onto individual. Of course the most apparent one is the official name and surname, first one carrying a message from parents onto their newborn child, and surname carrying the ancestral link. Nicknames are phrases that bind distinct characteristic of an individual among a given group, most often carrying some sort of inside joke or a recollection of an event sometimes also having periorative meaning like in my case, since you all call me literally 'a whore'. In the past, your nickname carried with it a recollection of an achievement - founding a repository, but i don't think anyone apart from me ever addresses you in that manner anymore. Due to your own actions, but that's beside the point with the advent of an internet, and it having little to no laws in the early days, it was important to conceal your identity with it, came internet nicknames, which were picked by individual itself carrying with them the narcistic image of one's creativity, or any other symbollic you might imagine, some for example, have silly names, just to see others saying dumb words when addresing them. See: guano or bulk. But there comes a quirk of human language and the way we are forming our thoughts, since optimisation is one of underlying concepts behind intelligence, people will strive to form their outwards thoughts (sentences) with as little effort as possible while not compromising on the meaning. Therefore, they attempt to shorten certain overused phrases to shorter counterparts that way, some of anons here are addresed by their short forms. For example, sjaal, rip, kf. And here comes another quirk of the names among every culture our planet managed to create, it is almost uniformly agreed that the first name should have 2 or three syllabes, any longer than that and people will subconsciously try to shorten it up by one means or another names have to be fast, and have to be concise which brings up to one other point they have to be CONSTANT. When you want to call out to someone, you need to know the exact keyword at any given time or situation. Otherwise, you might end up calling someone else by accident, and that would be huge loss of time. Now, it is PERFECTLY understandable to use different handles among different, non-diverging communities. Group A and group B only common element is you, as in, you do not need to know how my IRL friend address me. As long as among every /mjg/ anon it is uniformly accepted that me, as an individual is called Wafel or Kurwa. So, if a group cannot reach a consensus what exact phrase is or isn't the NAME of an individual it stops being one, and becomes a nuisance instead. And while i am not an advocate of giving a shit about masses everyone can see you are the only one pulling this off and the only reason you do so is to share your tulpa narrative that got obsolete in 2012 and is rightfuly associated with bronys, since it was their idea. And we all know what the general consensus about bronys is. So, while i do not like imposing any rules whatsoever, because i truly believe it limits the creativity of people, I am stating here and now - tulpas are not creative.
