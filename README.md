# Reorganization Plans
- Make a Guides section its own thing instead of being buried in the Library of Resources

# To do
- in the [issues](https://github.com/vg-mjg/mjg-repo/issues)

Want your implement your own shit that nobody can deny? Hate github and shan't ever make an account? As usual just win a tourney/league/whatever and make the request, as stated in the repo constitution article 4 section 4.
